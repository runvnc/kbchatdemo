Sec. 72.025. UNHUSBANDLIKE AND UNSANITARY CONDITIONS; ORDERS
OF DEPARTMENT. (a) It is a public nuisance to maintain premises in
a quarantined area in an unhusbandlike or unsanitary condition. A
person maintains an unhusbandlike or unsanitary condition if the
person:
(1) has host fruit on trees on the premises during the
host-free period; or
(2) permits fallen, refuse, or cull fruit to remain on the
ground or premises for a period of seven days or more during the
harvest period.
(b) Within the harvest period, each person shall clean fallen,
refuse, or cull fruit from his or her premises once in each seven-day
period. The fruit shall be buried at a depth of not less than 18
inches below the surface of well-tamped soil or disposed of in
another manner satisfactory to the department.
(c) The department may order each owner, part owner, or
caretaker of premises subject to this chapter to place the premises
in husbandlike and sanitary condition. The order shall be in
writing, dated, and signed or stamped by the commissioner or the
commissioner's designee. The order shall direct the owner, part
owner, or caretaker to place the premises in husbandlike and sanitary
condition under the supervision of an inspector of the department.
If the owner is a nonresident, the department shall give the owner 10
days' notice of the order by registered mail.

AMOUNT OF BOND.

(a)

- 842 -

Except as otherwise

AGRICULTURE CODE

provided by this section, the amount of each commission merchant's
bond must be equal to the nearest multiple of $1,000 that is more
than twice the average amount of the commission merchant's sales and
purchases of livestock on a business day during the preceding year or
portion of a year in which the person engaged in business as a
commission merchant. The average amount of sales and purchases for
one day is determined by dividing the total sales and purchases for
the preceding year by 308, regardless of the actual number of
business days.
(b) A bond may not be in an amount less than $2,000.
(c) If the amount equal to twice the average sales and
purchases of a commission merchant on a business day exceeds $50,000,
the bond must be in an amount equal to $50,000 plus 10 percent of the
amount of sales and purchases in excess of $50,000.
(d) If prior to filing bond a person has no previous sales and
purchases on which to determine the amount of the bond, the bond must
be in an amount adequate to cover the probable volume of business to
be done by that person, as determined by the county judge of the
county of the commission merchant's principal place of business.
After that person has engaged in business as a commission merchant
for one year, the amount of the bond shall be determined as otherwise
provided by this section.
(e) If in the judgment of the county judge the condition of the
business of a livestock commission merchant renders the bond
inadequate, the county judge shall notify the livestock commission
merchant and the commission merchant shall increase the bond to an
amount determined adequate by the county judge.

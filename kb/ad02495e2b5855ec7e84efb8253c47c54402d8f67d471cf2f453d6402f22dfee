of the activity and the associated responsibility; and
(2) has knowledge of the use and effects of restricted-use
and state-limited-use pesticides or regulated herbicides in the

examination administered under this section, the appropriate
regulatory agency shall furnish the person with an analysis of the
person's performance on the examination.

a valid license from another state that has license requirements
substantially equivalent to those of this state.

Sec. 164.005. ENTRY POWER. (a) An inspector is entitled to
enter any public or private place where cattle or sheep are kept or
ranged for the purpose of:
(1) ascertaining the presence of scabies infection;
(2) ascertaining any exposure to scabies; or
(3) inspecting, classifying, or treating cattle or sheep
for scabies infection or exposure.
(b) If the inspector under Subsection (a) of this section
desires to be accompanied by a peace officer, the inspector may apply
for and obtain a search warrant as provided by Section 161.047 of
this code.
(c) The person who owns or controls the place to be entered
under this section or who owns or controls the animals shall, on
request of the inspector or a member of the commission, gather the
animals on the range for inspection. Failure or refusal to gather
the animals is prima facie evidence that the premises and the animals
are infected with scabies and authorizes the commission to quarantine
the premises or animals in accordance with this chapter.

Sec. 74.001. PUBLIC NUISANCE. (a) The legislature finds that
cotton pests are a menace to the cotton industry, and that control of
those pests is a public necessity. Any portion of the state that is
susceptible to infestation by cotton pests must be protected from
this public nuisance and threat to the continued stability of the
cotton industry.
(b) The legislature finds that volunteer and other
noncommercial cotton is a public nuisance that threatens the cotton
growers' boll weevil eradication program by serving as a host for
cotton pests such as boll weevils and pink bollworms. To protect the
cotton industry of this state, volunteer and other noncommercial
cotton must be eliminated subject to the provisions of this chapter.

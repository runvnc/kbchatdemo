Sec. 60.124. APPORTIONMENT OF COST. The board shall apportion
the cost of an assessment according to the special benefits accruing
to the real property or product because of the project or service to
be financed by the assessment. The cost may be assessed on real
property or on an agricultural product produced on real property, as
appropriate:
(1) equally by front foot or by square foot of the land
area of the real property;
(2) equally by acreage of the real property;
(3) according to the value of the real property or
agricultural product as determined by the board, which may consider
the value of a structure or improvement on real property;
(4) based upon the productivity of land subject to the
assessment or on which the agricultural product subject to the
assessment is produced;
(5) in proportion to the value of the agricultural product
produced on the real property for the year preceding the year of the
assessment; or
(6) according to any other reasonable assessment plan that
imposes a fair share of the cost on property or agricultural products
similarly benefited.

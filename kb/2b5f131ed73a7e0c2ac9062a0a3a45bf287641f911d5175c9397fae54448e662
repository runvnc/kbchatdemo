location are subject to inspection by the department as the
department considers necessary.
(b) A licensee whose out-of-state location is inspected shall
reimburse the department for actual and necessary expenses incurred
during the inspection. If a licensee fails to pay those expenses
before the 11th day following the day on which the licensee receives
an invoice from the department, the department may:
(1) automatically cancel the person's license; or
(2) deny a license to any person who is connected with a
person whose license is canceled because of a violation of this
section.
(c) The actual and necessary expenses of the department for
each inspection of an out-of-state location may not exceed:
(1) the actual and necessary expenses for food, lodging,
and local transportation of the inspector; and
(2) the cost of the least expensive available space round
trip air fare from Austin to the location to be inspected.
(d) The department shall schedule as many inspections as
feasible within an area on each inspection trip. If more than one
licensee is inspected in an area during an inspection trip, the
expenses of the trip shall be divided equitably among the licensees
inspected.
(e) The department shall perform sufficient inspections of the
records of out-of-state licensees to ensure that out-of-state
licensees selling eggs in Texas pay inspection fees equal to the
percentage of out-of-state eggs sold in Texas. The department may
contract with the comptroller of public accounts to perform such
inspections.

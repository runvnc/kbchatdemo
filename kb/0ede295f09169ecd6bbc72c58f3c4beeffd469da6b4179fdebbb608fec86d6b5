may renew an unexpired license or registration by paying the required
renewal fee to the department before the expiration date of the
license or registration. A person whose license or registration has
expired may not engage in activities that require a license or
registration until the license or registration has been renewed under
the provisions of this section.
(b) If the person's license or registration has been expired
for 90 days or less, the person may renew the license or registration
by paying to the department 1-1/2 times the required renewal fee.

for longer than 90 days but less than one year, the person may renew
the license or registration by paying to the department two times the
required renewal fee.

for one year or longer, the person may not renew the license or
registration. The person may obtain a new license or registration by
submitting to reexamination, if applicable, and complying with the
requirements and procedures for obtaining an original license or
registration.
(e) If the person was licensed or registered in this state,
moved to another state, and is currently licensed or registered and
has been in practice in the other state for the two years preceding
application, the person may renew an expired license or registration
without reexamination, if required. The person must pay to the
department a fee that is equal to two times the required renewal fee
for the license or registration.
(f) At least 30 days before the expiration of a person's
license or registration, the department shall attempt to send notice
of the impending license or registration expiration to the person at
the license holder's or registrant's last known e-mail or physical
address according to the records of the department.

Sec. 44.009. STATE LIABILITY PROHIBITED. The state is not
liable to an eligible lending institution for payment of the
principal, interest, or any late charges on a loan made to an
eligible borrower. A delay in payment or default on a loan by an
eligible borrower does not affect the validity of the deposit
agreement. Linked deposits are not an extension of the state's
credit within the meaning of any state constitutional prohibition.

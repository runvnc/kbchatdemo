Sec. 201.048. ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE. (a) The secretary of
state shall examine the application for a certificate of organization
and the statement of the state board. If the secretary of state
finds that the name proposed for the conservation district is not
identical to that of another conservation district or so nearly
similar as to lead to confusion or uncertainty, the secretary shall
receive the application and statement, file them, and record them in
an appropriate book of record in the secretary's office.
(b) If the secretary of state finds that the name proposed for
the conservation district is identical to that of another
conservation district or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion or
uncertainty, the secretary shall certify that fact to the state board
and the state board shall submit to the secretary a new name for the
conservation district that is free of that defect. After receipt of
a name that is free of that defect, the secretary shall record the
application and statement, with the modified name, in an appropriate
book of record in the secretary's office.
(c) When the application and statement are filed and recorded
as provided by this section, the conservation district constitutes a
governmental subdivision and a public body corporate and politic.
(d) The secretary of state shall make and issue to the
directors a certificate, under the state seal, of the due
organization of the conservation district. The secretary shall
record the certificate with the application and statement.

Sec. 76.003. STATE-LIMITED-USE PESTICIDES. (a) After notice
and public hearing, the department may adopt lists of state-limiteduse pesticides for the entire state or for a designated area within
the state.
(b) A pesticide may be included on a list of state-limited-use
pesticides if the department determines that, when used as directed
or in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice,
the pesticide requires additional restrictions to prevent
unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the
economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of use of the
pesticide. However, the department shall not place a pesticide on
the state-limited-use list solely on the basis of actual damage or
risk of damage to water quality without first obtaining approval from
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission based on the
impact of the pesticide's use on water quality.
(c) The department shall formally request an opinion regarding
impact on water quality from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission during department consideration of any amendments to the
current list of state-limited-use pesticides.
(d) At the direction of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission in conjunction with its responsibilities pursuant to
Chapter 26, Water Code, the department shall consider any formal
request to add any pesticide to the state-limited-use list under
Subsection (b), and the department shall issue regulations regarding
the time, place, and conditions of such pesticide's use.
(e) The department may regulate the time and conditions of use
of a state-limited-use pesticide and may require that it be purchased
or used only:
(1) with permission of the department;
(2) under direct supervision of the department in certain
areas under certain conditions; or

(3) in specified quantities and concentrations.

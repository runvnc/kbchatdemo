Sec. 41.001. POLICY. It is in the interest of the public
welfare of the State of Texas that the producers of any agricultural
commodity be permitted and encouraged to develop, carry out, and
participate in programs of research, disease and insect control,
predator control, education, indemnification, and promotion designed
to encourage the production, marketing, and use of the agricultural
commodity. The purpose of this chapter is to authorize and prescribe
the necessary procedures by which the producers of an agricultural
commodity grown in this state may finance those programs. The
programs may be devised to alleviate any circumstance or condition
that serves to impede the production, marketing, or use of any
agricultural commodity.

Sec. 79.007. EXECUTION OF INTERSTATE COMPACT. This state
enters into a compact with all other states legally joining in the
compact in substantially the following form:
"INTERSTATE PEST CONTROL COMPACT
"ARTICLE I. FINDINGS
"The party states find that:
(1) in the absence of the higher degree of cooperation
among them possible under this Compact, the annual loss of
approximately 137 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is
virtually certain to continue, if not to increase;
(2) because of the varying climatic, geographic and
economic factors, each state may be affected differently by
particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to
protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious
dangers to them;
(3) the migratory character of pest infestations makes it
necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another to
complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of
infestation and reinfestation; and
(4) while every state is seriously affected by a
substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of
infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its
crops and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few
species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all
states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund,
from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest
control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they
may contribute in accordance with their relative interest, the most
equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control
programs.
"ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
"As used in this Compact, unless the context clearly requires a
different construction:
(1) "State" means a state, territory or possession of the
United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico.
(2) "Requesting state" means a state which invokes the
procedures of the Compact to secure the undertaking or

intensification of measures to control or eradicate one or more pests
within one or more other states.
(3) "Responding state" means a state requested to undertake
or intensify the measures to control or eradicate one or more pests.
(4) "Pest" means any invertebrate animal, pathogen,
parasitic plant or similar or allied organism which can cause disease
or damage in any crops, trees, shrubs, grasses, or other plants of
substantial value.
(5) "Insurance Fund" means the Pest Control Insurance Fund

Compact. The Insurance Fund shall contain moneys appropriated to it
by the party states and any donations and grants accepted by it. All
appropriations, except as conditioned by the rights and obligations
of party states expressly set forth in this Compact, shall be

any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each

"(e) The Executive Committee shall be composed of the chairman
of the Governing Board and four additional members of the Governing
Board chosen by it so that there shall be one member representing
each of four geographic groupings of party states. The Governing
Board shall make such geographic groupings. If there is
representation of the United States on the Governing Board, one such
representative may meet with the Executive Committee. The chairman of
the Governing Board shall be chairman of the Executive Committee. No
action of the Executive Committee shall be binding unless taken at a
meeting at which at least four members of such Committee are present
and vote in favor thereof. Necessary expenses of each of the five
members of the Executive Committee incurred in attending meetings of
such Committee, when not held at the same time and place as a meeting
of the Governing Board, shall be charges against the Insurance Fund.
"ARTICLE VI. ASSISTANCE AND REIMBURSEMENT
"(a) Each party state pledges to each other party state that it
will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the
strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized
that performance of this responsibility involves:
(1) The maintenance of pest control and eradication
activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level
that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of
this Compact.
(2) The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of
interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been
done in the absence of this Compact.
"(b) Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present
within its borders but present within another party state, or
whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for
the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such
activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more
difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to
cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may
request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the
Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one
or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent,
or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or
reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the
responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or
control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use

AGRICULTURE CODE

moneys available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and
efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
"(c) In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance
Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
(1) A detailed statement of the circumstances which
occasion the request for the invoking of the Compact.
(2) Evidence that the nest on account of whose eradication
or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an
agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass, or other
plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
(3) A statement of the extent of the present and projected
program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full
information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program
or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefore, in
connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of
introduction of the pest concerned.
(4) Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as
detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for
the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a
reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3
constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.
(5) A declaration as to whether, to the best of its
knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the
invoking of the Compact in the particular instance can be abated by a
program undertaken with the aid of moneys from the Insurance Fund in
one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a
program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.
(6) Such other information as the Governing Board may
require consistent with the provisions of this Compact.
"(d) The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due
notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the
Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to
the Compact administrator of each party state and to such other
officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party
states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be
entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such
meeting.
"(e) Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this
Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and
upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes

AGRICULTURE CODE

of this Compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or
Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The
Governing Board or Executive Committee may meet at any time or place
for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and
all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee,
with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefore
shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and
preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
"(f) A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a
determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing
given within twenty days of the determination with which it is
dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next
meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive
Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of
its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as
the Governing Board may authorize.
"(g) Responding states required to undertake or increase
measures pursuant to this Compact may receive moneys from the
Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs
expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for
expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing
Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise
procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
"(h) Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the
Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the
Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely
assistance or participation which may be available from the federal
government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of
the federal government for such assistance and participation.
"(i) The Insurance Fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum
of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent
and degree of assistance or participation between and among the
Insurance Fund, cooperating federal agencies, states, and any other
entities concerned.
"ARTICLE VII. ADVISORY AND TECHNICAL COMMITTEES
"The Governing Board may establish advisory and technical
committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and
private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its
functions. Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or
members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 585 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee. An
advisory or technical committee may furnish information and
recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from
the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee and
the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same: provided
that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive
Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of the Compact shall be
entitled to know the substance of any such information and
recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or
as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at
which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its
disposition of the application.
"ARTICLE VIII. RELATIONS WITH NONPARTY JURISDICTIONS
"(a) A party state may make application for assistance from the
Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such
application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing
Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application
with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in
this Article.
"(b) At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing
Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of this
Compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate,
and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or
Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be
entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive
Committee.
"(c) The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize
expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state
only after determining that the conditions in such state and the
value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify
them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any
conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure
of moneys from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter
into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other
jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to
protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to
expenditures and activities outside of party states.
"ARTICLE IX. FINANCE
"(a) The Insurance Fund shall submit to the executive head or
designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 586 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

Insurance Fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that
party state for a presentation to the legislature thereof.
"(b) Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations
of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party
states. The request for appropriations shall be apportioned among the
party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal
shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural
and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products,
produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops
and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of
information as in its judgment present the most equitable and
accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and
requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used
in obtaining information concerning value of products.
"(c) The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be
maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the
"Operating Account" and the "Claims Account." The Operating Account
shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration
of the Insurance Fund during the next ensuing two-year period. The
Claims Account shall contain all moneys not included in the Operating
Account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be
sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the Insurance Fund for a
period of three years. At any time when the Claims Account has
reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the
addition of moneys requested for appropriation by the party states,
the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata
basis in such manner as to keep the Claims Account within such
maximum limit. Any moneys in the Claims Account by virtue of
conditional donations, grants, or gifts shall be included in
calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that
such moneys are available to meet demands arising out of the claims.
"(d) The Insurance Fund shall not pledge the credit of any
party state. The Insurance Fund may meet any of its obligations in
whole or in part with moneys available to it under Article IV (g) of
this Compact, provided that the Governing Board take specific action
setting aside such moneys prior to incurring any obligation to be met
in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Insurance Fund
makes use of moneys available to it under Article IV (g) hereof, the
Insurance Fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment
of moneys by the party states adequate to meet the same.

receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the
Insurance Fund shall be subject to the audit and accounting
procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and
disbursements of funds handled by the Insurance Fund shall be audited
yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and report of the
audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of
the Insurance Fund.
"(f) The accounts of the Insurance Fund shall be open at any
reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the
party states and by any persons authorized by the Insurance Fund.
"ARTICLE X. ENTRY INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL
"(a) This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law
by any five or more states. Thereafter, this Compact shall become
effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.
"(b) Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take
effect until two years after the executive head of the withdrawing
state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive
heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any
liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to
the time of such withdrawal.
"ARTICLE XI. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
"This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate
the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this
Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state
or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the
validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability
thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not
be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the
constitution of any state participating herein the Compact shall
remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and
in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable
matters."

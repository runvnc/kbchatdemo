Sec. 102.151. POLICY. The unreasonable waste and inefficient
use of the citrus resources, caused by the marketing within this
state of greater quantities of fresh citrus fruit than are reasonably
necessary to supply the demands of the market, are not in the public
interest. The difficulty inherent in an attempt of individuals to
correlate within a reasonable degree the citrus production to current
demand creates chaotic economic conditions in the citrus areas of the
state of such severity as to imperil the ability of citrus producers
to contribute in appropriate amounts to the support of ordinary
governmental and educational functions, thus tending to increase the
tax burden of other taxpayers for the same purposes, and renders it
impossible for producers to be reasonably assured of an adequate
standard of living for themselves and their families. In the
interest of the public welfare and general prosperity of the state,
the unreasonable waste and inefficient use of citrus resources
involved in the marketing of citrus fruit in this state should be
eliminated, while at the same time preserving to citrus producers in
the area covered by this subchapter an equality of opportunity.
Acts 1981, 67th Leg., p. 1267, ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1981.

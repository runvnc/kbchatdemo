Sec. 12.023. EXPIRATION OF REGISTRATION OR LICENSES. The
department by rule shall adopt a system under which registrations or
licenses required by the department, including licenses issued under
Chapter 1951, Occupations Code, expire on various dates during the
year. The department may increase or decrease the term of an initial
or renewal license or registration so that all licenses held by a
person or a group of license holders expire on the same date. For
the period in which the registration or license expiration date is
changed, registration or license fees shall be prorated on a monthly
basis so that each registrant or licensee pays only that portion of
the fee that is allocable to the number of months during which the
registration or license is valid. On the next renewal of the
registration or license, the total renewal fee is payable.

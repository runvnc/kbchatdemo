(1) agriculture has been a critical element in the
economic, cultural, and historical development of this state;

due to urbanization, economic changes, and changes in agriculture;
(3) the effects of those changes are not limited to rural
areas and the agricultural community but affect citizens throughout
the state, including those in urban areas;
(4) agriculture is a vital component of a diversified state
economy and creates numerous businesses and job opportunities;
(5) agriculture is directly and substantially affected by
factors beyond the control of the industry, including adverse weather
conditions and changes in world commodity markets;
(6) agriculture renews the natural resources of this state
through the annual production of crops and livestock; and
(7) to ensure that agriculture remains a vital force in

guide governmental actions.

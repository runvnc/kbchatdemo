Sec. 122.201. HARVEST. (a) A license holder shall harvest the
plants from a plot not later than the 30th day after the date a
preharvest sample is collected under Section 122.154 unless field
conditions delay harvesting or the department authorizes the license
holder to delay harvesting. This subsection does not prohibit the
license holder from harvesting the plants immediately after the
preharvest sample is collected.
(b) A license holder may not sell or use harvested plants
before the results of a preharvest and, if applicable, postharvest
test performed on a sample representing the plants are received. If
the test results are not received before the plants are harvested,
the license holder shall dry and store the harvested plants until the
results are received.
(c) A license holder may not commingle harvested plants
represented by one sample with plants represented by another sample
until the results of the tests are received.

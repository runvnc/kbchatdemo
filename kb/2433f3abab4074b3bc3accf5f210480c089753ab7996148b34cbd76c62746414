Sec. 102.156. FINDINGS. (a) Following a hearing, the
department may execute a marketing agreement or issue a license only
if it finds that:
(1) the supply of a citrus fruit available for marketing
exceeds or is likely to exceed the demand for the fruit at prices
that will provide a reasonable return to representative producers of
that fruit;

unreasonable profits to producers of the citrus fruit and without
unreasonably enhancing prices of the citrus fruit to consumers; and
(4) the marketing plan will tend to advance public welfare
and conserve the agricultural wealth of the state by preventing
threatened economic or agricultural waste and will tend to prevent
chaotic marketing of the citrus fruit.
(b) The findings of the department, and the administration of
any marketing agreement or license, shall be based on relevant
considerations, including:

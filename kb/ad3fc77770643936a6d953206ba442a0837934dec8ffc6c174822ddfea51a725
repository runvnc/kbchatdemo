Sec. 142.009. IMPOUNDMENT OF ESTRAY. (a) The sheriff or the
sheriff's designee shall impound an estray and hold it for
disposition as provided by this chapter if:
(1) the owner of the estray is unknown;
(2) the sheriff or the sheriff's designee is unable to
notify the owner;
(3) the estray is dangerous to the public;
(4) the estray is located on public property and after
notification is not immediately removed by the owner; or
(5) the estray is located on public or private property and
is not redeemed not later than the fifth day after the date of
notification, unless the sheriff or the sheriff's designee determines
that the owner of the estray is making a good faith effort to comply
with Section 142.004(a).
(b) After impounding an estray, the sheriff or sheriff's
designee shall prepare a notice of estray stating at least:
(1) the name and address of the person who reported the
estray to the sheriff;
(2) the location of the estray when found;
(3) the location of the estray until disposition; and
(4) a description of the animal, including its breed, if
known, color, sex, age, size, markings of any kind, including ear
markings and brands, and other identifying characteristics.
(c) The sheriff or sheriff's designee shall file each notice of
estray in the estray records in the office of the county clerk.
(d) If the owner of the estray is unknown, the sheriff or the
sheriff's designee shall make a diligent search for the identity of
the owner of the estray, including a search in the county register of
recorded brands, if the animal has an identifiable brand. If the
search does not reveal the owner, the sheriff shall post a notice of
the impoundment of the estray on the public notice board of the
courthouse and advertise the impoundment of the estray:
(1) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at
least twice during the 15 days after the date of impoundment; or

Sec. 131.103. STOP-SALE ORDER. If the official or agency
responsible for enforcing a provision of this chapter or a rule or
quarantine adopted under this chapter has reason to believe a colony
of bees, equipment, pollen, or honey is in violation of the
provision, the official or agency may issue a written order to stop
the sale of the bees, equipment, pollen, or honey. When the official
or agency issues a stop-sale order, the official or agency shall
deliver a copy of the order to the person who possesses the bees,
equipment, pollen, or honey. On receipt of the copy of the order, a
person may not sell or transport the bees, equipment, pollen, or
honey until the official or agency that issued the order determines
that the items are in compliance with this chapter.

search warrant to a magistrate of the county in which the property is
located. The magistrate shall issue the search warrant on a showing
of probable cause by oath or affirmation.

warrant shall describe the animals and give the approximate number of
animals. If any of that information is unknown to the applicant, the
application and warrant shall state that the information is unknown.

person to whom it is issued to enter the property for the exercise of

warrant authorizes the peace officer and the assistants to perform
any duty authorized by this chapter.
(e) A search warrant issued under this section permits entry
and reentry for the purposes of this section for a period of 60 days
beginning on the day on which it is issued. After that period,
additional search warrants may be issued as often as necessary.

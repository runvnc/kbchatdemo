treat, the person was still the owner, part owner, or caretaker of
animals subject to treatment located on the premises described in the
order. In that case, the state is required to prove only that the

treatment located on the premises at the time the order was served.
(b) After the service of an order to treat, if there are no
longer any animals subject to treatment located on the premises and

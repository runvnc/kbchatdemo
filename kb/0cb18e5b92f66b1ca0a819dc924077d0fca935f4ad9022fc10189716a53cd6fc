Sec. 45.001. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) The
legislature finds that Texas and Israel have many interests in
common. They face many of the same difficulties in agriculture; the
geography of both areas produces semiarid climatic conditions; there
is present in both areas a rising demand for a limited supply of
water coupled with increasing pressures to minimize the use of energy
in all aspects of agriculture. Scientific and technological
cooperatives already produce close ties between the two areas while
engaging in binational projects for scientific and industrial
research and development.
A program to support joint agricultural research and development
by, and the development of trade and business relations between,
Texas and Israel will address common problems and make substantial
contributions to the development of agriculture, trade, and business
in both areas. Since Texas has long emphasized broad-based
agricultural research and Israel has originated and developed
agricultural technologies designed to maximize production with
minimal use of resources such as water and labor, each of the two
areas will benefit by sharing information and expertise.

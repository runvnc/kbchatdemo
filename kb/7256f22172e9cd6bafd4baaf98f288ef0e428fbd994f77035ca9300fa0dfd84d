(c) If the court finds that a violation of this chapter may be
corrected by proper processing or labeling, the court may order that
the feed be delivered to the licensee of the feed for processing or
labeling under the supervision of the service. Before entering that
order, the court shall:
(1) enter the decree;
(2) require that all costs, fees, and expenses be paid;
and
(3) require the licensee of the feed to post good and
sufficient bond conditioned on the proper labeling and processing of
the feed.
(d) The licensee of the feed shall pay all costs incurred by
the service in the supervision of labeling or processing under
Subsection (c) of this section. The court shall return the bond to
the licensee when the service notifies the court that the commercial
feed is no longer in violation of this chapter and that the licensee
has paid the expenses of supervision.

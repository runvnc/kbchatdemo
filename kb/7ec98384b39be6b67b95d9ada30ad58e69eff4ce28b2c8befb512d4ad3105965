Sec. 201.0511. EFFECT OF DISSOLUTION. (a) On issuance of a
certificate of dissolution under Section 201.051 of this code, the
ordinances and regulations adopted by the dissolved district cease to
be in effect.
(b) A contract to which a dissolved district was a party
remains in effect according to the terms of the contract. The state
board is substituted for the dissolved district for purposes of
performance of a contract. Under a contract of the dissolved
district, the state board has all the rights and liabilities under
the contract that the board of directors of the dissolved district
had under the contract, including the right to sue and the liability
to be sued.
(c) The dissolution of a conservation district does not affect
a lien on a judgment obtained or an action pending under Section

obligations with respect to a lien or an action under Section 201.128
as the board of directors of the dissolved district had under that
section.

Sec. 14.033. BOND CANCELLATION. (a) A warehouse operator may
not cancel a bond approved by the department unless the department
first gives written approval of a substitute bond.
(b) The surety may cancel a bond by sending notice of intent to
cancel by registered or certified mail to the department.
Cancellation of a bond may not be effective before the 91st day
following the day on which the surety mails notice of intent to
cancel. On receipt of notice of cancellation of a bond, the
department shall promptly notify the warehouse operator involved.
Liability under the bond ceases to accrue on the effective date of
cancellation. Notwithstanding cancellation under this section, the
department or a depositor may collect under the bond for any claim
that arose during the period during which the bond was in effect,
provided that the claim is filed within the applicable limitations
period established under Section 14.065.
(c) The surety shall send a copy of the notice required by this
section to any government agency requesting it.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a
public grain warehouse license is automatically suspended if the
warehouse operator fails to file a new bond before the cancellation
of a bond is effective.
(e) The suspension of a license under this section continues as
long as the warehouse operator fails to maintain the bond required by
this chapter.

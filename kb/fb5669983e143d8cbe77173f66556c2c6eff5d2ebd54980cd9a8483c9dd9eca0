Sec. 148.027. COMMINGLING OF LIVESTOCK UNDER LIEN. (a) If an
animal, its carcass, or its products is under a lien and is
commingled with other livestock, carcasses, or products so that the
identity is lost, the lien extends to all of the commingled animals,
carcasses, or products as if the lien had been perfected originally
in all of them.
(b) Each lien extended under this section is on a parity with
any other lien extended under this section.
(c) A lien extended under this section is not enforceable
against a person without actual knowledge of the lien who purchases
one or more of the carcasses or products in the ordinary course of
trade or business from the party who commingled the carcasses or
products, nor against a subsequent transferee from that purchaser,
but is enforceable against the proceeds of that sale.
Acts 1981, 67th Leg., p. 1388, ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1981.

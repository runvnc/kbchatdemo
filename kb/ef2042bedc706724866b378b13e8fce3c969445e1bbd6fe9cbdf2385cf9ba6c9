Sec. 143.055. SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS TO ADOPT OR REPEAL FREE
RANGE. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section, if
an election is held under this subchapter another election for the
purpose of adopting or repealing the limited period of free range may
not be held in that county or area within two years after the date of
the election.
(b) If the limited period of free range is defeated at a
countywide election, this section does not prohibit another election
on the proposition from being held immediately thereafter for an area
within the county. If the limited period of free range is defeated
at an election in an area within a county, no other election covering
that area may be held except an election in the same area, which must
be held at least one year after the prior election.
(c) If at a subsequent election in a county or area that has
adopted the limited period of free range the majority of votes are
cast against the proposition, the limited period of free range is
repealed and a person may not permit hogs to run at large in that
county or area effective on the 11th day following the day on which
the proclamation is issued. If the majority of the votes are cast
for the proposition, the operation of the limited period of free
range is not affected.

Sec. 74.118. AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT PLANTING OF COTTON AND
REQUIRE PARTICIPATION IN ERADICATION PROGRAM. (a) The commissioner
may adopt reasonable rules regarding areas where cotton may not be
planted in an eradication zone if there is reason to believe planting
will jeopardize the success of the program by making treatment
impracticable or present a hazard to public health or safety.
(b) The commissioner may adopt rules relating to noncommercial
cotton located in eradication zones and requiring that all growers of
commercial cotton in an eradication zone participate in a boll weevil
or pink bollworm eradication program that includes cost sharing as
required by the rules.
(c) Notice of prohibitions and requirements shall be given by
publication for one day each week for three successive weeks in a
newspaper having general circulation in the affected area.
(d) The commissioner may adopt a reasonable schedule of penalty
fees to be assessed against growers in a designated eradication zone
who do not meet the requirements of the rules issued by the
commissioner relating to reporting of acreage and participation in
cost sharing. The penalty fees adopted may not exceed $50 per acre.
(e) If a grower fails to meet the requirements of rules adopted
by the commissioner, the commissioner may order the destruction of
cotton not in compliance with the rules. Costs incurred by the
commissioner in the destruction of cotton may be assessed against the
grower.

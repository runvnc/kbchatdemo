Sec. 251.003. ESTABLISHED DATE OF OPERATION. For purposes of
this chapter, the established date of operation is the date on which
an agricultural operation commenced operation. If the physical
facilities of the agricultural operation are subsequently expanded,
the established date of operation for each expansion is a separate
and independent established date of operation established as of the
date of commencement of the expanded operation, and the commencement
of expanded operation does not divest the agricultural operation of a
previously established date of operation.

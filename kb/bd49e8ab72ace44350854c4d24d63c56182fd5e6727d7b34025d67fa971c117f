Sec. 71.043. ANNUAL REGISTRATION. (a) A florist or nursery
owner must register with the department under this section each
nursery, greenhouse, orchard, garden, or other place growing for sale
or lease, offering for sale or lease, or otherwise distributing a
florist item or nursery product.
(b) A florist or nursery owner may apply for registration or
renewal of registration by submitting an application prescribed by
the department and an annual fee. The fee shall be the sum of:
(1) an amount based on the size and type of a location, as
defined by department rule, where a florist or nursery owner grows
for sale or lease or offers for sale or lease a florist item or
nursery product; and
(2) an optional additional amount equal to 15 percent of
the amount described by Subdivision (1), to fund the Texas nursery

(b-1) The department shall allow an applicant to elect whether
to pay the amount described by Subsection (b)(2). An applicant is
not required to pay that amount to apply for or renew registration.
(c) Registrations under this section expire one year after
issuance. A person who fails to submit a renewal fee on or before
the expiration date of the registration must pay, in addition to the
renewal fee, the late fee provided by Section 12.024 of this code.
(d) Upon receipt of the correct annual registration fee, the
department shall issue a registration certificate for each location a
florist or nursery owner has registered.

or florist item without a registration certificate issued under this

for which the agency is responsible.
(b) Rules adopted under this section may:
(1) prescribe methods to be used in the application of a
restricted-use or state-limited-use pesticide or regulated herbicide;
(2) relate to the time, place, manner, method, amount, or
concentration of pesticide application or to the materials used in
pesticide application; and
(3) restrict or prohibit use of a restricted-use or statelimited-use pesticide or regulated herbicide in designated areas
during specific periods of time.

account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of
the use of the pesticide.

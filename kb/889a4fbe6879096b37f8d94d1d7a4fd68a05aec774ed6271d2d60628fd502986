(3) a certified private applicator as defined in Section
76.112(j) of this code.
(b) An individual is under the direct supervision of a licensed
applicator if the individual is acting under the instructions and
control of a licensed applicator who is responsible for the actions
of the individual and who is available if and when needed. A
licensed applicator may not supervise an applicator whose license or
certificate is under suspension or revocation. The licensed
applicator is not required to be physically present at the time and
place of the pesticide application unless the label of the applied
pesticide states that the presence of the licensed applicator is
required.
(c) A licensed applicator is responsible for assuring that the
person working under the licensee's direct supervision is
knowledgeable of the label requirements and rules and regulations
governing the use of pesticides. A licensed applicator satisfies the
requirements of this subsection if the person working under the
licensee's direct supervision has been trained as a handler under the
federal worker protection standard.
(d) A person who is authorized under this chapter to use
restricted-use or state-limited-use pesticides or regulated
herbicides shall comply with all applicable federal and state rules,
regulations, and court orders regarding the use of restricted-use or
state-limited-use pesticides or regulated herbicides.
(e) Except as provided by Section 76.003(e), a person may not
purchase a restricted-use or state-limited-use pesticide or regulated
herbicide unless the person is a licensed or a certified applicator
or authorized by a licensed or certified applicator to purchase or
take delivery for the applicator.
(f) The other provisions of this section notwithstanding, the
department may adopt rules or establish programs that the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency or another federal agency requires as
a condition for receiving:
(1) approval to authorize use of certain restricted-use or
state-limited-use pesticides or regulated herbicides;
(2) federal funding for licensing or certification of
pesticide applicators;
(3) federal funding for pesticide law enforcement efforts;
or
(4) other federal funding related to pesticide risk

applicators for which the federal standards are imposed.

Sec. 60.088. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; AFFIDAVIT OF INTEREST.
(a) Except as provided in this section:
(1) a director may participate in all board votes and
decisions; and
(2) Chapter 171, Local Government Code, governs conflicts
of interest for directors.
(b) Section 171.004, Local Government Code, does not apply to
the district. A director who has a substantial interest in a
business or charitable entity that will receive a pecuniary benefit
from a board action shall file a one-time affidavit declaring the
interest. An additional affidavit is not required if the director's
interest changes. After the affidavit is filed with the board
secretary, the director may participate in a discussion or vote on
that action if:
(1) a majority of the directors have similar interests in
the same entity; or
(2) all similar business or charitable entities in the
district will receive a similar pecuniary benefit.
(c) A director who is also an officer or employee of another
public entity may not participate in the discussion of or vote on a
matter regarding a contract with that other public entity.
(d) For purposes of this section, a director has a substantial
interest in a business or charitable entity in the same manner that a
person would have a substantial interest in a business entity under
Section 171.002, Local Government Code.

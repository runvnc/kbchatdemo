Sec. 61.014. STOP-SALE ORDER. (a) If the department has
reason to believe that agricultural or vegetable seed is in violation
of any provision of this chapter, the department may issue and
enforce a written or printed order to stop the sale of the seed. The
department shall present the order to the owner or custodian of the
lot of seed. The person who receives the order may not sell the seed
until the seed is discharged by a court under Subsection (b) of this
section or until the department finds that the seed is in compliance
with this chapter.
(b) The owner or custodian of seed prohibited from sale by an
order of the department is entitled to sue in a court of competent
jurisdiction where the seed is found for a judgment as to the
justification of the order and for the discharge of the seed in
accordance with the findings of the court.
(c) This section does not limit the right of the department to
proceed as authorized by another section of this chapter.

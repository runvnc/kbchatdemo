to carry out this subchapter.
(b) The department may hold hearings, take testimony,
administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, and issue subpoenas for the
production of relevant books, records, or documents. A person may

incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or
forfeiture. An individual may not be prosecuted or subjected to any
penalty or forfeiture because of any transaction, matter, or thing
concerning which the person is required to testify or produce
evidence before the department in obedience to a subpoena. An
individual so testifying is not exempt from prosecution and
punishment for perjury committed in that testimony.
(c) The department may permit an administrative committee to
use the various employees or officers of the department in carrying
out this subchapter or a marketing agreement or license under this
subchapter.

of another state or the United States in order to secure uniformity

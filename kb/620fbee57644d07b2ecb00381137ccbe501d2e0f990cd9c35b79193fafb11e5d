Agricultural laborers employed by employers covered by this chapter
who may be exposed to chemicals covered by this chapter shall be
informed of the exposure and shall have access to the workplace
chemical list and MSDSs for those chemicals. Laborers, on request,
shall be provided a copy of a specific MSDS. In addition, laborers

required by this chapter. These rights are guaranteed on January 1,
1988.
(b) An employer covered by this chapter may not discharge,
cause to be discharged, otherwise discipline, or in any manner
discriminate against an agricultural laborer because the laborer has
made an inquiry, filed a complaint, assisted an inspector of the
department who may make or is making an inspection under Section
125.016 of this code, instituted or caused to be instituted any
proceeding under or related to this chapter, testified or is about to
testify in such a proceeding, or exercised any rights afforded under
this chapter on behalf of the laborer or on behalf of others. Pay,
position, seniority, or other benefits may not be lost as the result
of the exercise of any right provided by this chapter.
(c) Any waiver by an agricultural laborer of the benefits or
requirements of this chapter is against public policy and is void.
Any employer's request or requirement that a laborer waive any rights
under this chapter as a condition of employment is a violation of
this chapter.

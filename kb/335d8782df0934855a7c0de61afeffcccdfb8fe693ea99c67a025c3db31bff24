Sec. 14.023. LICENSING PROCEDURE. (a) The department may
issue, renew, or amend a license following a determination that:
(1) the applicant has filed an acceptable bond, a financial
statement in a form prescribed by the department, and proof of
casualty insurance required by this chapter;
(2) the warehouse is suitable for storage of grain and
inspection by department personnel;
(3) the applicant has complied with this chapter and rules
adopted under this chapter; and
(4) the applicant has met the net worth or deficiency bond
requirements of Section 14.031(e).
(b) An applicant must file a separate application for each
license, renewal, or amendment and shall accompany each application
for a license or renewal with an annual license fee, as provided by
department rule. The department shall prescribe the information to
be contained in the application. A person who fails to submit a
renewal fee on or before the expiration date of the license must pay,
in addition to the renewal fee, the late fee provided by Section
12.024.
(c) If an applicant for a license previously operated a grain
warehouse in this state or another state and that warehouse ceased to
operate while the applicant was the operator, the applicant must
submit with the application evidence acceptable to the department
that all debts from the previous operation evidenced by receipts have
been satisfied. The department may not issue a license to an
applicant who the department determines has not satisfied all such
debts from a previous operation.

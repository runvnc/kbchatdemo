Sec. 74.130. USE OF BIO-INTENSIVE CONTROLS. (a) The
commissioner shall develop and adopt rules to allow a cotton grower
in an eradication program to use biological, botanical, or other nonsynthetic pest control methods. In developing the rules, the
commissioner shall consider:
(1) scientific studies and field trials of the
effectiveness of a proposed alternative control method;
(2) the feasibility of using a proposed alternative control
technique within a particular region;
(3) the degree of monitoring necessary to establish the
success of the use of a proposed alternative control; and
(4) methods to prevent the use of substances that would
impede the use of alternative controls and the promotion of
beneficial insect populations.
(b) A cotton grower that chooses to use an alternative method
of control as provided in Subsection (a) shall notify the board. The
board and the cotton grower shall coordinate their actions to prevent
the use of substances that would impede the use of alternative
controls and the promotion of beneficial insect populations.
(c) The cotton grower shall pay any additional cost of biointensive control in addition to any assessment.

Sec. 1.001. PURPOSE OF CODE. (a) This code is enacted as a
part of the state's continuing statutory revision program, begun by
the Texas Legislative Council in 1963 as directed by the legislature
in Chapter 448, Acts of the 58th Legislature, Regular Session, 1963
(Article 5429b-1, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The program
contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and
permanent statute law without substantive change.
(b) Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision
program, the purpose of this code is to make the agriculture law more
accessible and understandable, by:
(1) rearranging the statutes into a more logical order;
(2) employing a format and numbering system designed to
facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of
the law;
(3) eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional,
expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions; and
(4) restating the law in modern American English to the
greatest extent possible.

Sec. 91.061. GRADING CHARACTERISTICS. (a) A bright onion has
the attractive pearly luster normal for Bermuda onions.
(b) The diameter of an onion is the greatest dimension at a
right angle to a straight line between the stem and the root.
(c) A mature onion is firm.
(d) An onion is sunburned if it is discolored from exposure to
the sun. The green color running down the veins in the crystal wax
variety is not characteristic of sunburn unless the surface between
the veins is green.
(e) An onion is well shaped if it is generally round, although
not necessarily having exactly the typical flat Bermuda shape. A
well-shaped onion may not have three or more sides, be thick-necked,
or be badly pinched by dry, hard soil.
(f) An onion is practically free from damage if on casual
examination no injury is apparent.
(g) Onions are of one variety if they consist of one type, such
as the crystal wax (white), white Bermuda (yellow), or red Bermuda
(red), and not a mixture of types.
(h) An onion is sound if it is not water-soaked, decayed,
sprouted, or otherwise defective.
(i) The white Bermuda (yellow) onion is noticeably pink if it
has a pink color that is readily apparent on casual examination.

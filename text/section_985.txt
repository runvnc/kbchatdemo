Sec. 76.103. PROGRAM CONTINGENT ON FEDERAL FUNDS. (a) The
licensing of commercial applicators, noncommercial applicators, and
private applicators is contingent on the availability of federal
funds to pay part of the costs of administering and enforcing the
program.
(b) If federal funds and other funds made available for this
program are not sufficient to pay all costs of administering and
enforcing the program, the department shall certify that fact and
discontinue the licensing of commercial applicators, noncommercial
applicators, and private applicators. The department shall publish
notice of the discontinuance of the program in the Texas Register.
(c) If sufficient funds become available after discontinuance,
the department shall certify the availability of sufficient funds to
pay all costs of administration and enforcement of the program and
shall resume the licensing of commercial applicators, noncommercial
applicators, and private applicators. The department shall publish
notice of resumption of the program in the Texas Register.
(d) The department shall determine the effective date of
discontinuance or resumption of the program, but the date may not be
before the date of publication of notice in the Texas Register.
(e) During any period in which the program has been
discontinued, a person is not required to have a license provided by
this subchapter in order to use pesticides, but a person may be
prosecuted for acts committed or omitted when the program was in
effect.

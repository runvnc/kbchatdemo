Sec. 76.111. APPLICATOR BUSINESSES; PROOF OF FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY. (a) In this section:

state-limited-use or restricted-use pesticide or regulated herbicide
to the land of another for compensation and who:
(A) is a licensed commercial applicator; or
(B) employs at least one licensed commercial
applicator.
(2) "M-44 device" means a nonexplosive, spring-operated

predation control.
(b) This section does not apply to an employee or agent of an

department protecting persons who may suffer damages as a result of
the operations of the applicator business, its employees, and its
agents.
(d) The proof of financial responsibility required by this
section is not required to apply to damages or injury to agricultural
crops, plants, or land being worked on by the applicator business,
its employees, or its agents.
(e) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amount of
the proof of financial responsibility may not be less than $100,000
for each occurrence for property damage and may not be less than
$100,000 for each occurrence for bodily injury or a general aggregate
at a minimum of $200,000 for each occurrence. The head of a
regulatory agency by rule may require different amounts of coverage
for different classifications of operations under this chapter. Each
commercial M-44 applicator license applicant must provide proof of
financial responsibility acceptable to the department for bodily
injury and property damage coverage insuring the applicator against
liability for damage to persons or property occurring as a result of
operations performed in the course of the application to premises or
any other property under the applicator's care, custody, or control.
The department will strive to set minimum acceptable coverage at an
amount that is economically feasible to applicants. The coverage
must at all times be maintained at not less than the amount set by
the agency head or the Texas Department of Insurance.
(f) The head of a regulatory agency may accept a liability
insurance policy in the proper sum which has a deductible clause in
an amount of not more than $1,000 for the total amount of the
liability insurance policy required by this section. If the
applicator business has not satisfied the requirement of the
deductible amount in any prior legal claim, an agency head may not
accept a policy with a deductible clause unless the applicator
business furnishes the agency with a surety bond that satisfies the
amount of the deductible clause as to all claims that may arise as a
result of the operation of the applicator business.
(g) An applicator business shall cease state-limited-use or
restricted-use pesticide or regulated herbicide application
operations during a period in which the applicator business is unable
to provide adequate proof of financial responsibility under
Subsection (e).

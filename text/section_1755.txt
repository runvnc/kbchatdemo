Sec. 161.063. CONTENTS OF NOTICE. (a) A quarantine notice
must state the requirements and restrictions under which animals may
be permitted to enter this state or to be moved from a quarantined
area within this state. If the seriousness of the disease is
sufficient to warrant prohibiting the movement of animals, the notice
must state that the movement is prohibited. The quarantine notice
must state the class of persons authorized by the commission to issue
certificates or permits permitting movement.
(b) A quarantine notice must state the cause for which the
quarantine is established, whether for infection or for exposure.
(c) A quarantine notice must describe the area or premises
quarantined in a reasonable manner that enables a person to identify
the area or premises, but is not required to describe the area or
premises by metes and bounds.
(d) If the quarantine regulates or prohibits the movement of a
carrier or potential carrier of a disease, the commission may
prescribe any exceptions, terms, conditions, or provisions that the
commission considers necessary or desirable to promote the objectives
of this chapter or to minimize the economic impact of the quarantine
without endangering those objectives or the health and safety of the
public. Any exceptions, terms, conditions, or provisions prescribed
under this subsection must be stated in the quarantine notice.

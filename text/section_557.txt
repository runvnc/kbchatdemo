Sec. 58.016. FISCAL ACCOUNTING OF ADMINISTRATION. (a) All
funds acquired under this chapter may be used for administration of
this chapter, except that funds representing the proceeds of bonds
issued by the authority or pledged to the payment of the bonds of the
authority shall be held and used as provided in the resolution or
indenture authorizing the bonds.
(b) On or before August 1 of each year, the administrator shall
file with the board the proposed annual budgets for the young farmer
loan guarantee program under Subchapter E, the farm and ranch finance
program under Chapter 59, and the programs administered by the board
under this chapter for the succeeding fiscal year. If there is no
administrator, the commissioner shall assume the duties of the
administrator in connection with preparation of the budget. The
budget must set forth the general categories of expected expenditures
out of revenues and income of the funds administered by the authority
and the amount on account of each. On or before September 1 of each
year, the board shall consider the proposed annual budget and may
approve it or amend it.
If for any reason the authority does not
adopt an annual budget before September 2, no expenditures may be
made from the funds until the board approves the annual budget. The
authority may adopt an amended annual budget for the current fiscal
year.
(c) The authority shall have an audit of its books and accounts
for each fiscal year by a certified public accountant. The cost of
the audit is an expense of the authority.
(d) On or before January 1 of each year, the authority shall
prepare a report of its activities for the preceding fiscal year.
The report must set forth a complete operating and financial
statement.
(e) The board members, administrator, and staff of the
authority may not be personally liable for bonds issued or contracts
executed by the authority and shall be exculpated and fully
indemnified in the documents relating to any bonds except in the case
of fraudulent or wilful misconduct on the part of the individual
seeking exculpation or indemnification.

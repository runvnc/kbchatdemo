provision is favored by a majority of the producers who, during a
representative period determined by the department:

fruit in the area covered by the agreement or license; and
(B) produced more than 66-2/3 percent of the volume of
the citrus fruit that was produced for market within the area of the
state covered by this subchapter or was produced within the area of
this state covered by this subchapter for market elsewhere.

provision of a marketing agreement or license is effective only if
announced on or before the end of the current marketing period
specified in the agreement or license.

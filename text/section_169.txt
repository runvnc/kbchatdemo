Sec. 14.042. INSURANCE CANCELLATION. (a) A warehouse operator
may not cancel an insurance policy approved by the department unless
the department gives written approval of a substitute policy.
(b) The insurer may cancel an insurance policy by sending
notice of intent to cancel by registered or certified mail to the
department. Cancellation of an insurance policy is not effective
before the 31st day following the date the insurer mails notice of
intent to cancel. On receipt of notice of cancellation of an
insurance policy, the department shall promptly notify the warehouse
operator involved.
(c) The insurer shall send a copy of the notice required by
this section to any government agency requesting the copy.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a
public grain warehouse license is automatically suspended if the
warehouse operator fails to file a new certificate of insurance
before the cancellation of an insurance policy is effective or fails
to provide a certification of ownership under Section 14.041(c).
(e) The suspension of a license under this section continues as
long as the warehouse operator fails to maintain the insurance
required by this chapter.

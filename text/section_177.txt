Sec. 14.055. DUPLICATE RECEIPTS. (a) Except as otherwise
provided by this section, if a receipt issued under this chapter is
outstanding, another receipt covering all or part of the grain
covered by the initial receipt may not be issued by the warehouse
operator or any other person. If a receipt is lost, stolen, or
destroyed, the owner is entitled to a new receipt as a duplicate or
substitute for the missing receipt. The duplicate or substitute
receipt has the same legal effect as the original receipt and must:
(1) state that it is in lieu of the original receipt; and
(2) bear the number and date of the original receipt.
(b) Before issuing a duplicate receipt, the warehouse operator
shall require from the owner an indemnity bond of double the market
value of the grain covered by the missing receipt. The bond must be
in a form and with a surety prescribed by the department to fully
protect all rights under the missing receipt.
(c) A warehouse operator may not obtain, purchase, or become a
surety on a bond for a lost, stolen, or destroyed receipt.
(d) A court may not order delivery of grain covered by a lost,
stolen, or destroyed receipt without requiring the bond provided by
this section.
Renumbered from Sec. 14.019 and amended by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch.

Sec. 203.053. CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTING AND PRIORITIZING WATER
SUPPLY ENHANCEMENT PROJECTS. (a) The board shall adopt rules
establishing:
(1) criteria for accepting project proposals; and
(2) a system to prioritize projects for each funding cycle,
giving priority to projects that balance the most critical water
conservation need and the highest projected water yield.
(b) The criteria required by Subsection (a)(1) must include a
requirement that each proposal state the projected water yield of the
proposed project, as modeled by a person with expertise in hydrology,
water resources, or another technical area pertinent to the
evaluation of water supply.
(c) The board shall consult with stakeholders, including
hydrologists and representatives from soil and water conservation
districts, to develop by rule standard methods of reporting the
projected water yield under Subsection (b).
(d) In prioritizing projects under Subsection (a)(2), the board
shall consider:
(1) the need for conservation of water resources within the
territory of the project, based on the state water plan adopted under
Section 16.051, Water Code;
(2) projected water yield of areas of the project, based on
soil, slope, land use, types and distribution of trees, brush, and
other vegetative matter, and proximity of trees, brush, and other
vegetative matter to rivers, streams, and channels;
(3) any method the project may use to control brush;
(4) cost-sharing contract rates within the territory of the
project;
(5) the location and size of the project;
(6) the budget of the project and any associated requests
for grant funds submitted under this title;
(7) the implementation schedule of the project; and
(8) the administrative capacities of the board and the
entity that will manage the project.
(e) In prioritizing projects under Subsection (a)(2), the board
may consider:
(1) scientific research on the effects of brush removal on
water supply; and
(2) any other criteria that the board considers relevant to
assure that the water supply enhancement program can be most

Sec. 51.016. LIABILITY OF MEMBERS. (a) Except as provided by
this section, a member of a society is not liable to the society or
its creditors for an amount that exceeds the amount unpaid on the
member's membership certificates. When the member pays for the
certificates in full, the member's liability ceases.
(b) A society, by clear provisions of its bylaws, may provide
that:
(1) each member is liable for an amount, in addition to
that provided by Subsection (a) of this section, equal to the price
paid for the membership certificates owned by the member and payable
on assessment of the board of directors for payment of the society's
obligations; or
(2) each member may waive the right to claim personal
property exempt from seizure for the member's obligations to the
society.

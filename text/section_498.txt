Sec. 52.064. COMMON STOCK. (a) If a marketing association
consists of fewer than 20 stockholders, a stockholder may not own
more than one share of the marketing association's issued common
stock. If the marketing association consists of 20 or more
stockholders, a stockholder may not own more than one-twentieth of a
marketing association's issued common stock. A marketing association
with more than 20 stockholders, by its bylaws, may limit the amount
of common stock that one stockholder may own to an amount less than
one-twentieth of the issued common stock.
(b) At any time, except when the association's debts exceed 50
percent of its assets, a marketing association may purchase its
common stock at the book value conclusively determined by its board
of directors and pay cash for the stock within one year thereafter.
(c) A person may not transfer common stock of a marketing
association to a person who does not produce agricultural products
handled by the association. The association shall state this
restriction in its bylaws and shall print the restriction on each
common stock certificate.

Sec. 201.023. FUNDS MANAGEMENT. (a) Except as provided by
Section 201.081, the state board shall deposit all money and
securities received by it in the state treasury to the credit of a
special fund known as the state soil conservation fund. That fund
shall be appropriated to the state board for use in the
administration of this chapter and is subject to the same care and
control while in the state treasury as other funds of the state.
(b) The financial transactions of the state board are subject
to audit by the state auditor in accordance with Chapter 321,
Government Code.
(c) The state board by resolution may authorize the chairman of
the board or the administrative officer to approve claims and
accounts payable by the board. That approval is sufficient to
authorize the comptroller of public accounts to issue a warrant drawn
on the funds appropriated to the board for payment of the claim and
is sufficient to authorize the comptroller to honor payment of the
warrant.
(d) The state board may accept any donation or contribution in
any form, including money, materials, or services, and from any
source for the purpose of carrying out this chapter, including the
cost of conducting the annual meeting of conservation district
directors under Section 201.081 of this code.

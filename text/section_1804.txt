Sec. 163.021. CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS. (a) The commission by
rule may prescribe criteria for classifying areas in the state for
purposes of brucellosis control. The commission may prescribe
differing control measures and procedures according to the
classification of the areas. The classifications shall be based on
criteria that use sound epidemiological principles and are similar to
the criteria provided by federal brucellosis control regulations.
(b) The commission by rule may designate as a particular
classification any area consisting of one county or two or more
contiguous counties. The designation of an area for state purposes
need not be the same as the designation of the area for federal
purposes.

Sec. 14.086. CIVIL PENALTY. (a) A person who violates this
chapter is liable for a civil penalty of not less than $500 or more
than $10,000 for each violation. Each day a violation occurs or
continues may be considered a separate violation for purposes of a
civil penalty assessment.
(b) On request of the department, the attorney general or the
county attorney or the district attorney of the county in which the
violation is alleged to have occurred shall file suit to collect the
penalty. The attorney general, a county attorney, or a district
attorney may file suit under this section without a request from the
department.
(c) A county attorney, a district attorney, or the attorney
general shall sue in the name of the state for the collection of a
penalty provided by this section.
(d) A civil penalty collected under this section shall be
deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general revenue
fund. All civil penalties recovered in suits initially instituted by
a local government or governments under this section shall be divided
equally between the state and the local government or governments,
with 50 percent of the recovery to be paid to the general revenue
fund and the other 50 percent to be paid equally to the local
government or governments initially instituting the suit.
(e) A civil penalty may not be collected for any violation that
constituted the basis for a department proceeding to assess an
administrative penalty, regardless of whether the department was
successful in obtaining a judgment for the administrative penalty.

Sec. 122.358. POWERS AND DUTIES OF PEACE OFFICERS. (a) A peace
officer may inspect and collect a reasonably sized sample of any
material from the plant Cannabis sativa L. found in a vehicle to
determine the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of the plant

plant material is marihuana, the peace officer may not:

this state until the person transporting the hemp provides the
documentation required by Section 122.356. The peace officer shall
immediately release the hemp to the person if the person produces
documentation required by that section.
(c) If a peace officer has probable cause to believe that a
person transporting hemp in this state is also transporting marihuana
or a controlled substance, as defined by Section 481.002, Health and
Safety Code, or any other illegal substance under state or federal
law, the peace officer may seize and impound the hemp along with the
controlled or illegal substance.
(d) This subchapter does not limit or restrict a peace officer
from enforcing to the fullest extent the laws of this state
regulating marihuana and controlled substances, as defined by Section
481.002, Health and Safety Code.

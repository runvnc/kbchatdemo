distribution of the pesticide or requiring the pesticide to be
removed and secured from further distribution. The department shall
present the order to the owner or custodian of the pesticide. The

(2) does not present a hazard to the public health, safety,
or welfare.
(b) This section does not limit the right of the department to
proceed as authorized by another section of this chapter.

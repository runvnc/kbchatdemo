ANNUAL REGISTRATION.

AGRICULTURE CODE

(a) A person who buys and sells or leases or offers for sale or
lease a nursery product and who has facilities that maintain or
preserve the nursery product and prevent that product from becoming
dry, infested, or diseased is a nursery dealer.
(b) A person is a nursery agent if the person sells or leases,
offers for sale or lease, or takes mail orders for the sale or lease
of a nursery product and:
(1) is entirely under the control of a nursery grower or
nursery dealer with whom the nursery product offered for sale or
lease originates; or
(2) operates on a cooperative basis for handling a nursery
product with a nursery grower or nursery dealer.
(c) A nursery agent shall possess proper credentials from the
nursery grower or nursery dealer the agent represents or cooperates
with. A nursery agent who fails to possess proper credentials is
subject to this subchapter as a nursery dealer.
(d) A nursery dealer or nursery agent must register with the
department under this section before offering for sale or lease or
otherwise distributing a nursery product.
(e) A nursery dealer or nursery agent may apply for
registration or renewal of registration by submitting an application
prescribed by the department and an annual fee. The fee shall be the
sum of:
(1) an amount based on the size and type of a location, as
defined by department rule, where a nursery dealer or nursery agent
offers a nursery product for sale or lease; and
(2) an optional additional amount equal to 15 percent of
the amount described by Subdivision (1), to fund the Texas nursery
and floral account.
(e-1) The department shall allow an applicant to elect whether
to pay the amount described by Subsection (e)(2). An applicant is
not required to pay that amount to apply for or renew registration.
(f) Registrations under this section expire one year after
issuance. A person who fails to submit a renewal fee on or before
the expiration date of the registration must pay, in addition to the
renewal fee, the late fee provided by Section 12.024 of this code.
(g) Upon receipt of the correct annual registration fee, the
department shall issue a registration certificate for each location a
florist or nursery owner has registered.

Sec. 61.009. GERMINATION AND PURITY TESTING. (a) All
agricultural or vegetable seed sold or offered, exposed, or
transported for sale in this state shall be tested to determine the
percentage of germination.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the
germination test shall be performed within nine months, not including
the calendar month in which the test was completed, immediately prior
to being sold or offered, exposed, or transported for sale. The
department by rule may designate a period of time longer than nine
months if the department finds that the seed is packaged in a
container or under conditions that will maintain the viability of the
seed under ordinary conditions of handling during the longer period
of time.
(c) At the request of a farmer or dealer, the department may
conduct or provide for the testing of seed for purity and
germination. The department may fix by rule and collect fees for
tests made under this subsection.

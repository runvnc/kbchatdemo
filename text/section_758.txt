Sec. 63.122. CONDEMNATION OF FERTILIZER. (a) If, after
examination and analysis, the service finds that a commercial
fertilizer is in violation of a provision of this chapter, the
service shall petition the district or county court in whose
jurisdiction the fertilizer is located for an order for the
condemnation and confiscation of the fertilizer. If the court
determines that the fertilizer is in violation of this chapter, the
fertilizer shall be disposed of by sale or destruction in accordance
with the order of the court.
(b) If a condemned commercial fertilizer is sold under
Subsection (a) of this section, the proceeds of the sale, less court
costs and charges, shall be paid into the state treasury.
(c) If the court finds that a violation of this chapter may be
corrected by proper processing or labeling, the court may order that
the fertilizer be delivered to the registrant for processing or
labeling under the supervision of the service. Before entering that
order, the court shall:
(1) enter the decree;
(2) require that all costs, fees, and expenses be paid;
and
(3) require the registrant to post good and sufficient bond
conditioned on the proper labeling and processing of the fertilizer.
(d) The registrant of the fertilizer shall pay all costs
incurred by the service in the supervision of labeling or processing
under Subsection (c) of this section. The court shall return the
bond to the registrant when the service notifies the court that the
commercial fertilizer is no longer in violation of this chapter and
that the registrant has paid the expenses of supervision.

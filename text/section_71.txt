Sec. 12.041. SCHOOL BREAKFAST AND LUNCH PROGRAM. (a) The
department, the Texas Education Agency, and the Health and Human
Services Commission shall ensure that applicable information
maintained by each entity is used on at least a quarterly basis to
identify children who are categorically eligible for free meals under
the national free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch program. In
complying with this subsection, the department, agency, and
commission shall use information that corresponds to the months of
the year in which enrollment in the food stamp program is customarily
higher than average.
(b) The department shall determine the feasibility of
establishing a process under which school districts verify student
eligibility for the national free or reduced-price breakfast and
lunch program through a direct verification process that uses
information maintained under the food stamp and Medicaid programs, as
authorized by 42 U.S.C. Section 1758(b)(3), as amended by Section
105(a) of the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004
(Pub. L. No. 108-265), and 7 C.F.R. Sections 245.6a(a)(1) and (3) and
245.6a(b)(3). If the department determines the process described by
this subsection is feasible, the department may implement the
process.

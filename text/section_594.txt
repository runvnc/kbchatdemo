Sec. 58.074. STATE LIABILITY PROHIBITED. The state is not
liable to an eligible lending institution for payment of the
principal, interest, or any late charges on a loan made under this
subchapter. A delay in payment or default on a loan by a borrower
does not affect the validity of the deposit agreement. Linked
deposits are not an extension of the state's credit within the
meaning of any state constitutional prohibition.

Sec. 167.101. INSPECTORS. (a) The commissioners court of a
county in which the commission conducts tick eradication may nominate
the number of local inspectors found by the commission to be
necessary for tick eradication in that county. The commission shall
appoint those persons nominated unless, following appointment of
local inspectors, the commission finds that the county is trying to
retard tick eradication or is nominating persons who are incompetent
or negligent in the performance of duty. In that case, the
commission may ignore the nominations of the county.
(b) If a commissioners court fails or refuses to nominate
persons as local inspectors, the commission shall appoint local
inspectors without nomination.
(c) Local inspectors work under the direction and orders of the
commission and are subject to discharge by the commission. The
commission shall fix and the state shall pay the salaries of local
inspectors, but a county may pay the salary and traveling expenses of
a local inspector.
(d) The commission may employ county and district supervising
inspectors without nomination by the commissioners courts.
(e) Only an inspector appointed for the purpose may conduct
tick eradication or issue permits and certificates certifying animals
to be free from ticks or exposure to ticks. An inspector shall issue
those permits and certificates in accordance with the rules of the
commission.

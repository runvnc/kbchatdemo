Sec. 163.066. REGULATION OF MOVEMENT OF CATTLE; EXCEPTION.
(a) As a control measure, the commission by rule may regulate the
movement of cattle. The commission may restrict the intrastate
movement of cattle even though the movement of the cattle is
unrestricted in interstate or international commerce. The commission
may require testing, vaccination, or another procedure that is
epidemiologically sound before or following the movement of cattle.
(b) The commission may not adopt a rule that prohibits a person
from moving cattle owned by that person within unquarantined
contiguous lands owned or controlled by that person.
(c) Any restriction on the movement of cattle imposed under
provisions of this chapter may be modified or set aside by the
commission upon application by the cattle owner, provided that the
owner can show impending unusual hardship resulting from such
restriction. Contributory factors may include but are not limited to
prolonged drought, inadequacy of pasturage or usual feed supply
resulting from disaster or other unforeseeable circumstance, or
economic hardship of the cattle owner; provided that individual
animals under restriction shall be handled in a manner to be
prescribed by the commission.

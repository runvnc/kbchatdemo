attorney having jurisdiction, or both, to institute proceedings in
the board's behalf; or
(3) forward to the department for action under Section
41.1011 a complaint and any original evidence or other information
establishing probable cause.
(b) Suit under this section may be brought in Travis County or
a county in which the person who is alleged to have failed to collect
or remit an assessment conducts business related to the commodity
subject to the uncollected or unpaid assessment.

SEARCH WARRANT.

(a)

AGRICULTURE CODE

In administering the program, the laboratory may:
(1) require the registration of hatcheries and hatchery
supply flocks;
(2) examine, test, monitor, and collect samples from any
flock, whether a hatchery supply flock or not, if the flock is
suspected of being infected or a potential source of infection;
(3) examine, test, monitor, and collect samples from any
hatchery supply flock;
(4) enter premises where flocks are kept or eggs are
hatched as necessary to administer this chapter; and
(5) promulgate rules necessary to the control and
eradication of pullorum disease and fowl typhoid.
(b) If a person conducting an inspection of premises under
Subsection (a)(4) of this section desires to be accompanied by a
peace officer, the person may apply to any magistrate in the county
where the property is located for the issuance of a search warrant.
In applying for the warrant, the person shall describe the premises
or place to be entered and shall by oath or affirmation give evidence
of probable cause to believe that entry is necessary for the control
or eradication of pullorum disease or fowl typhoid. The application
for the warrant and the warrant itself need only describe the
property or premises in terms sufficient to enable the owner or
caretaker to know what property is referred to in the documents. The
warrant entitles the person to whom it is issued to be accompanied by
a peace officer and by assistants. The issuing magistrate may not
charge court costs or other fees for the issuance of this warrant.

Sec. 91.121. GRADING CHARACTERISTICS. (a) A potato is
practically free from a named injury to the appearance if the injury
is not readily apparent on casual examination and if damaged areas
can be pared without appreciable waste in excess of that which occurs
with perfect potatoes. Loss of the outer skin only is not an injury
to appearance.
(b) The diameter of a potato is the greatest dimension at right
angles to the longitudinal axis.
(c) A potato is free from serious damage if the appearance of
the potato is not damaged from a named injury over more than 20
percent of the surface and if the damage can be removed by paring
with waste of not more than 10 percent by weight in excess of that
which occurs with perfect potatoes.

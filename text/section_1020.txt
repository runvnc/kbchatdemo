Sec. 76.184. REPORTS OF PESTICIDE ADVERSE EFFECTS. (a) A
person claiming adverse effects from an application of a pesticide
may file with the appropriate regulatory agency a complaint report.
The complaint report must contain the name of the person, if known,
allegedly responsible for the application of the pesticide and the
name of the owner or lessee of the land on which the pesticide was
applied. The regulatory agency shall prepare a form printed in
English and Spanish to be furnished to persons for use in filing
complaint reports. The form may contain other information that is
within the person's knowledge and requested by the head of the
regulatory agency.
(b) As soon as practicable after receiving a complaint report,
the regulatory agency shall notify the licensee, the owner or lessee
of the land on which the alleged application occurred, and any other
person who may be charged with responsibility for the adverse effects
claimed. The regulatory agency shall furnish copies of the complaint
to those people on request.
(c) To assess any adverse effects, the complaining party shall
permit the regulatory agency and the licensee to observe, within
reasonable hours, the land or nontarget organism alleged to have been
adversely affected.
(d) Failure to file a complaint does not bar a civil or
criminal action from being filed and maintained.
(e) The regulatory agency by rule may adopt procedures to be
followed in the investigation of a report claiming adverse effects
from an application of the pesticide.

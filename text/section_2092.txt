Sec. 251.005. EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. (a) For
purposes of this section, the effective date of a governmental
requirement is the date on which the requirement requires or attempts
to require compliance as to the geographic area encompassed by the
agricultural operation. The recodification of a municipal ordinance
does not change the original effective date to the extent of the
original requirements.
(b) A governmental requirement of a political subdivision of
the state other than a city:
(1) applies to an agricultural operation with an
established date of operation subsequent to the effective date of the
requirement;
(2) does not apply to an agricultural operation with an
established date of operation prior to the effective date of the
requirement; and
(3) applies to an agricultural operation if the

governmental requirement was in effect and was applicable to the
operation prior to the effective date of this chapter.
(c) A governmental requirement of a city does not apply to any
agricultural operation situated outside the corporate boundaries of
the city on the effective date of this chapter. If an agricultural
operation so situated is subsequently annexed or otherwise brought
within the corporate boundaries of the city, the governmental
requirements of the city do not apply to the agricultural operation
unless the requirement is reasonably necessary to protect persons who
reside in the immediate vicinity or persons on public property in the
immediate vicinity of the agricultural operation from the danger of:
(1) explosion, flooding, vermin, insects, physical injury,
contagious disease, removal of lateral or subjacent support,
contamination of water supplies, radiation, storage of toxic
materials, or traffic hazards; or
(2) discharge of firearms or other weapons, subject to the
restrictions in Section 229.002, Local Government Code.
(c-1) A governmental requirement may be imposed under
Subsection (c) only after the governing body of the city makes
findings by resolution that the requirement is necessary to protect
public health. Before making findings as to the necessity of the
requirement, the governing body of the city must use the services of
the city health officer or employ a consultant to prepare a report to
identify the health hazards related to agricultural operations and
determine the necessity of regulation and manner in which
agricultural operations should be regulated.
(c-2) A governmental requirement of a city relating to the
restraint of a dog that would apply to an agricultural operation
under Subsection (c) does not apply to a dog used to protect
livestock on property controlled by the property owner while the dog
is being used on such property for that purpose.
(d) This section shall be construed to maintain, to the limited
degree set forth in this section, the authority of a political
subdivision under prior law over nonconforming uses but may not be
construed to expand that authority.
(e) A governmental requirement of a political subdivision of
the state does not apply to conduct described by Section 42.09(f),
Penal Code, on an agricultural operation.

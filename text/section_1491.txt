WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE. (a) A commercial aquaculture facility
located within the coastal zone and engaged in the production of
shrimp must:
(1) obtain a site-specific wastewater discharge permit from
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality before the facility may
discharge wastewater if the facility will discharge wastewater or
another substance into waters in the state;
(2) provide the report described in Subsection (b) to the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality;
(3) obtain an amendment to its site-specific discharge
permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality before the
facility may increase the amount of discharge or change the nature of
the discharge above levels allowed by the wastewater discharge permit
issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, except as
otherwise provided by Section 26.0191, Water Code; and
(4) provide the report described by Subsection (b) before
the facility may increase the amount of discharge, or change the
nature of the discharge above levels allowed by the wastewater
discharge permit issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality, except as otherwise provided by Section 26.0191, Water Code.
(b) Before issuing a permit to a new aquaculture facility
designed for the commercial production of shrimp that will discharge

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shall require the applicant
to provide a report describing the existing environmental conditions
at the proposed site, including aquatic habitat and the conditions of

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shall establish guidelines
relating to the report required by Subsection (b) that:

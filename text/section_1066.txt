Sec. 78.065. DISSOLUTION. (a) After a dissolution order has
been issued, the board may not exercise any power except to terminate
the affairs of the district.
(b) If at the time of dissolution the district does not have
sufficient funds to pay claims against the district and if annual
assessments already imposed are insufficient to pay the claims, the
board may impose and collect further annual assessments in an amount
necessary to pay the claims.
(c) If at the time of dissolution there are no claims against
the district, the board shall pay any remaining funds to the
treasuries of the counties located in the district. Each county
shall deposit the funds received to the credit of the general fund of
the county. The amount of the payment to each county must be in the
same proportion as the area of the county is to the total area of the
district.

Sec. 101.013. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE ON DEMAND. (a) If a
licensee or a person required to be licensed causes a producer,
seller, or owner, or an agent of a producer, seller, or owner, to
part with control or possession of all or any part of the person's
perishable commodities and agrees by contract of purchase to pay the
purchase price on demand following delivery, the licensee or person
required to be licensed shall make payment immediately on demand.
(b) If a person makes demand for the purchase price in writing,
the mailing of a registered letter that makes the demand and is
addressed to the licensee or person required to be licensed at their
business address is prima facie evidence that demand was made at the
time the letter was mailed.
(c) If the producer, seller, owner, or agent waives the right
to payment of purchase price on demand, the contract for the
handling, purchase, or sale of the perishable commodities must be in
writing. The parties shall prepare the contract in duplicate and set
out in the contract the full details of the transaction. If the
contract does not specify the time and manner of settlement, the
licensee shall pay the full amount called for by the contract
directly to the producer, seller, owner, or agent before the 31st day
following the day of delivery of the perishable commodities into the
licensee's control.

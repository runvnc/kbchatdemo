(2) require observance of particular methods of
cultivation, including:
(A) contour cultivating, contour furrowing, lister
furrowing, or strip cropping;
(B) planting, sowing, or seeding land with waterconserving and erosion-preventing plants, trees, or grasses; and
(C) forestations and reforestations;
(3) specify cropping programs and tillage practices to be
observed;
(4) require the retirement from cultivation of highly
erosive areas or of areas on which erosion may not be adequately
controlled if cultivation is carried on; or
(5) provide other means, measures, operations, or programs
that may assist conservation of soil resources or prevent or control
soil erosion in the conservation district, having due regard for the
legislative determinations made in Section 201.001 of this code.
(c) Land-use regulations must be uniform throughout the
conservation district, except that the directors may classify land in
the conservation district according to relevant factors, including

or cropping or tillage practices in use. The land-use regulations
may vary with the type or class of land affected, but must be uniform
as to all land within the type or class.

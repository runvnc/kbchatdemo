(e) If, after investigation of a possible violation and the
facts surrounding that possible violation, the department determines
that a violation has occurred, the department may issue a violation
report stating the facts on which the conclusion that a violation
occurred is based, recommending that an administrative penalty under
this section be imposed on the person charged, and recommending the
amount of that proposed penalty. The department shall base the
recommended amount of the proposed penalty on the seriousness of the
violation determined by consideration of the factors set forth in
Subsection (d) of this section.
(f) Not later than the 14th day after the date on which the
report is issued, the department shall give written notice of the
report to the person charged. The notice shall include a brief
summary of the charges, a statement of the amount of the penalty
recommended, and a statement of the right of the person charged to a
hearing on the occurrence of the violation or the amount of the
penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of
the penalty.
(g) Not later than the 20th day after the date on which notice
is received, the person charged shall accept the determination of the
department made under Subsection (e), including the recommended
penalty, or make a written request for a hearing on the
determination.
(h) If the person charged with the violation accepts the
determination of the department or fails to timely respond to the
notice, the commissioner shall issue an order approving the
determination and ordering the payment of the recommended penalty.
(i) If the person charged requests a hearing, the department
shall set a hearing and give notice of the hearing. The hearing
shall be conducted under Section 12.032. The administrative law
judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and promptly
issue to the commissioner a proposal for decision as to the
occurrence of the violation, including a recommendation as to the
amount of the proposed penalty if a penalty is warranted. Based on
the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the
judge, the commissioner by order may find a violation has occurred
and may assess a penalty or may find that no violation has occurred.
(j) The department shall give notice of the commissioner's
order under Subsection (h) or (i) to the person charged. The notice

the findings of fact and conclusions of law separately

under Subsection (h) shall pay the penalty.
(k) Within the 30-day period immediately following the day on

2001.144, Government Code, the person charged with the penalty shall:
(1) pay the penalty in full;
(2) pay the amount of the penalty and file a petition for
judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the
amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and
the amount of the penalty; or
(3) without paying the amount of the penalty, file a
petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the
violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the
violation and the amount of the penalty.
(l) Within the 30-day period, a person who acts under
Subsection (k)(3) of this section may:
(1) stay enforcement of the penalty by:
(A) paying the amount of the penalty to the court for
placement in an escrow account; or
(B) giving to the court a supersedeas bond that is
approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is
effective until all judicial review of the commissioner's order is
final; or
(2) request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty
by:
(A) filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the
person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the
amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the
supersedeas bond; and

five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the
affidavit. The court shall hold a hearing on the facts alleged in
the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay the enforcement
of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are true. The
person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the
person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to
give a supersedeas bond.
(n) If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and
the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the department may
refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount
of the penalty.
(o) Judicial review of the order of the commissioner under
Subsection (i):
(1) is instituted by filing a petition as provided by
Subchapter G, Chapter 2001, Government Code; and
(2) is under the substantial evidence rule.
(p) If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the
court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the
person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty. If the
court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court
shall order that no penalty is owed.
(q) When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court
shall proceed under this subsection. If the person paid the amount
of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the
court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued
interest be remitted to the person. The rate of the interest is the
rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period
beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the
penalty is remitted. If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if
the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall
order the release of the bond. If the person gave a supersedeas bond
and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order
the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
(r) A penalty collected under this section shall be deposited
in the state treasury to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.

2001, Government Code, except as provided in Subsections (t) and (u).

administrative decision on which the administrative law judge relied
is incorrect or should be changed.

and legal basis for a determination under Subsection (t).

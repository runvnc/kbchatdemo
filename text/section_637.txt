Sec. 60.026. ACTION ON PETITION. (a) After the hearing, if
the commissioners court finds that the petition conforms to the
requirements of Section 60.022 and that the creation of the district
and the proposed development is feasible and necessary and would
serve the public purpose of economic development in the counties to
be included in the district, the commissioners court shall make that
finding and enter an order granting the petition and creating the
district.
(b) The order may specify the cost of publishing notice and
conducting hearings for the creation of the district together with
the cost of conducting the confirmation election. A county may
require the petitioners to pay the county the appropriate amounts
specified in the order creating the district at the time the order
becomes final.
(c) If the commissioners court finds that the petition does not
conform to the requirements of Section 60.022 or that the creation of
the district and the proposed project is not feasible and necessary
and would not serve the public purpose of economic development in the
counties to be included in the district, the commissioners court
shall make that finding in an order and deny the petition.

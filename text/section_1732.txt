Sec. 161.047. ENTRY POWER. (a) A commissioner or a
veterinarian or inspector employed by the commission may enter public
or private property for the exercise of an authority or performance
of a duty under this chapter.

of the county in which the property is located. The magistrate shall
issue the search warrant on a showing of probable cause by oath or
affirmation. The search warrant shall describe the place to be

caretaker of the property to identify the property described, but the
warrant is not required to describe the property by field notes or by
metes and bounds.
(c) A search warrant issued under this section authorizes the
person to whom it is issued to be accompanied by a peace officer and
by as many assistants as the person considers necessary.
(d) A search warrant issued under this section permits entry
and reentry for the purposes of this section for 30 days after the
day on which it is issued. After that period, additional search
warrants may be issued as often as necessary.

Sec. 74.129. EXEMPTION FROM LAWSUITS, LIABILITY, TAXATION, AND
LEGAL PROCESS. The legislature recognizes that the foundation,
acting under the supervision and control of the commissioner, is
carrying out an important governmental function and that therefore
the foundation, as a quasi-governmental entity, must be immune from
lawsuits and liability except to the extent provided in Chapter 101,
Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and as provided by this section.
Therefore, no claims may be brought or continued against the
foundation except: (1) claims allowed by Chapter 101, Civil Practice
and Remedies Code; and (2) claims pending against the foundation on
April 30, 1997, plus attorney's fees and costs of court. With the
exception of finally adjudicated claims arising from Chapter 101,
Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and claims for assessments,
attorney's fees, and costs of court paid by named plaintiffs in
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

contributions, funds, and assessments received or held by the

attachment, execution, or other seizure and from state and local
taxation, levies, sales, and any other process and are unassignable.
Nothing in this section shall affect or impair any existing or future
indebtedness or any existing or future security interest created
under a note, security agreement, assignment, or other loan agreement
between the foundation and a lender or any judgment, to the extent
such judgment allows recovery against the foundation pursuant to a
note, security agreement, loan agreement, or other document.

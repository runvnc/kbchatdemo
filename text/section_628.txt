Sec. 60.003. FINDINGS. (a) Agriculture is a critical element
in Texas' economic, cultural, and historical development but is under
considerable pressure as a result of market concentration,
competitive forces, adverse weather conditions, urbanization, and
other factors.
(b) Agriculture is a vital component of a diversified state
economy, creates numerous economic opportunities, and serves to renew
the state's natural resources through the annual production of crops
and livestock and the use and reuse of agricultural by-products.
(c) The state must increase economic opportunities, including
value-added operations, to keep more agriculture-based activity in
the state and ensure that agriculture remains a vital force in the
economy. In order to accomplish this goal, the state must provide
incentives to promote the development of agricultural facilities.
(d) The means and measures authorized by this chapter are in
the public interest and serve a public purpose of this state in
promoting the development of agricultural facilities and operations
by providing incentives for the development of projects that result
in employment and economic activity.
(e) The creation of agricultural development districts is
essential to accomplish the purposes of Section 52-a, Article III,
Texas Constitution, and to accomplish the other public purposes
stated in this chapter and further serves the purposes of Section 59,
Article XVI, and Section 52, Article III, Texas Constitution.

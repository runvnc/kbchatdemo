Sec. 101.015. SETTLEMENT ON GRADE AND QUALITY. (a) Except as
otherwise provided by this section, a licensee or a person required
to be licensed shall settle with the producer or seller of perishable
commodities on the basis of the grade and quality that is referred to
in the contract under which the licensee or person required to be
licensed obtained possession or control of the perishable
commodities.
(b) If the perishable commodities have been inspected by a
state or federal inspector in this state and found to be of a
different grade or quality than that referred to in the contract, the
licensee or person required to be licensed shall settle with the
producer or seller of the perishable commodities on the basis of the
grade and quality determined by the inspector.
(c) This section does not prevent parties, instead of an
inspection, from agreeing in writing that the grade or quality of the
perishable commodities were different from that referred to in the
contract.
(d) Failure of a licensee to settle with a producer or seller
on grade and quality in the manner provided by this section is a
ground for revocation of the licensee's license.

TITLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 1.001. PURPOSE OF CODE. (a) This code is enacted as a
part of the state's continuing statutory revision program, begun by
the Texas Legislative Council in 1963 as directed by the legislature
in Chapter 448, Acts of the 58th Legislature, Regular Session, 1963
(Article 5429b-1, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The program
contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and
permanent statute law without substantive change.
(b) Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision
program, the purpose of this code is to make the agriculture law more
accessible and understandable, by:
(1) rearranging the statutes into a more logical order;
(2) employing a format and numbering system designed to
facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of
the law;
(3) eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional,
expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions; and
(4) restating the law in modern American English to the
greatest extent possible.

failure to comply with any obligation of the warehouse operator under
this chapter that would have been covered by a bond.
(b) Recovery on a bond shall be prorated if claims exceed

grain that could not have been avoided through the exercise of that
care.

CHAPTER 45. TEXAS-ISRAEL EXCHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM
Sec. 45.001. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) The
legislature finds that Texas and Israel have many interests in
common. They face many of the same difficulties in agriculture; the
geography of both areas produces semiarid climatic conditions; there
is present in both areas a rising demand for a limited supply of
water coupled with increasing pressures to minimize the use of energy
in all aspects of agriculture. Scientific and technological
cooperatives already produce close ties between the two areas while
engaging in binational projects for scientific and industrial
research and development.
A program to support joint agricultural research and development
by, and the development of trade and business relations between,
Texas and Israel will address common problems and make substantial
contributions to the development of agriculture, trade, and business
in both areas. Since Texas has long emphasized broad-based
agricultural research and Israel has originated and developed
agricultural technologies designed to maximize production with
minimal use of resources such as water and labor, each of the two
areas will benefit by sharing information and expertise.

agricultural businesses that the board considers to present a
reasonable risk and have a sufficient likelihood of repayment. In
establishing criteria for participation, the board shall give
priority to eligible agricultural businesses that include producers
of Texas agricultural products in the ownership of the businesses.
The board shall adopt collateral or security requirements to ensure
the full repayment of that financial assistance and the solvency of
any program implemented under this chapter. The board shall approve
any and all extensions of that financial assistance under this
chapter, provided that the board may delegate this approval authority
to the administrator or the commissioner.

lenders that may participate in the programs that may be established
by the board.
(c) Eligible agricultural businesses or lenders participating
in the authority's programs shall pay the costs of applying for,
participating in, and administering and servicing the program, in
amounts the board considers reasonable and necessary. The board
shall charge an administrative fee for guaranteeing a loan under
Subchapter E that may not be less than one percent of the amount of
the guaranteed loan.
Any costs not paid by the eligible
agricultural businesses or lenders shall be paid from the funds of
the authority, including those funds established from bond proceeds.
(d) The board by rule shall adopt an agreement to be used
between a lender and an approved applicant under which the authority
makes a payment from the Texas agricultural fund for the purpose of

(1) to provide financial assistance:
(A) to eligible agricultural businesses; and
(B) for programs designed to further rural economic
development;
(2) to pay costs of issuance of those bonds and the

authority's bonds are not and do not create or constitute a pledge,
giving, or lending of the faith or credit or taxing power of the
state. Each bond of the authority issued under this section must

pay the principal of or any premium or interest on the bond, and that
neither the faith or credit nor the taxing power of the state is
pledged, given, or loaned to such a payment.

issuance of those bonds, including mortgages or other interests in
property financed, with the proceeds of such bonds, repayments of
financial assistance, earnings from investments or deposits of the
funds of the authority, fees, charges, and any other amounts or
payments received pursuant to this chapter, and any appropriations,
grants, allocations, subsidies, supplements, guaranties, aid,
contribution, or donations from the state or federal government or
any other person.
(d) The board may make additional covenants with respect to the
bonds and the pledged revenues and may provide for the flow of funds,

the establishment and maintenance and investment of funds, which may
include interest and sinking funds, reserve funds, program funds, and
other funds. Those funds shall be kept and maintained in escrow and
in trust by the comptroller for and on behalf of the authority and
the owners of its revenue bonds, in funds held outside the treasury
pursuant to Chapter 404, Government Code. Those funds shall be used
only as provided by this chapter, and pending their use shall be
invested as provided by any resolution of the authority. Legal title
to those funds shall be in the authority unless or until paid out as
provided by this chapter or by the resolutions authorizing the
authority's bonds. The comptroller, as custodian, shall administer
those funds strictly and only as provided by this chapter and in
those resolutions. The comptroller shall invest the funds in
investments authorized by law for state funds. The state shall take
no action with respect to those funds other than that specified in
this chapter and in those resolutions.
(e) The board may provide in the resolution authorizing any
revenue bonds for the issuance of additional bonds to be equally and
ratably secured by lien on the revenues and receipts, or for the
issuance of subordinate lien bonds.
(f) Revenues of the authority that may be used as a source of
payment for the bonds or to establish a reserve fund to secure the
payment of debt service on the bonds or related obligations of the
authority include repayments of financial assistance, money
appropriated by the legislature to the authority for the purpose of
paying or securing the payment of debt service on the authority's
revenue bonds or related obligations, federal or private money
allocated to financial assistance programs established under this
chapter, amounts paid under any credit agreement for those purposes,
or any other money that the authority pledges or otherwise commits
for those purposes. To the extent that pledged revenues include
amounts appropriated by the legislature, the revenue bonds must state
on their face that those revenues are available to pay debt service
only if appropriated by the legislature for that purpose.

interest or may bear interest at any rate or rates, fixed, variable,
floating, or otherwise, determined by the board or determined
pursuant to any contractual arrangements approved by the board, not

1204, Government Code. Interest on the bonds may be payable at any
time, and the rate of interest on the bonds may be adjusted at such
time as may be determined by the board or as may be determined
pursuant to any contractual arrangement approved by the board. In

powers granted to the governing body of an issuer in connection with
the issuance of obligations under Chapter 1371, Government Code, to
the extent not inconsistent with this chapter.
(b) The bonds issued under this chapter and interest coupons,
if any, are investment securities under the terms of Chapter 8,
Business & Commerce Code. The bonds are exempt securities under The
Securities Act (Title 12, Government Code), and unless specifically
provided otherwise, under any subsequently enacted securities act.
Any contract, guaranty, or any other document executed in connection
with the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter is not a security
under The Securities Act (Title 12, Government Code) and, unless
specifically provided otherwise, any subsequently enacted securities
act. The board is authorized to do all things necessary to qualify
the bonds for offer and sale under the securities laws and
regulations of the United States and of the states and other
jurisdictions in the United States as the board shall determine.
(c) The bonds may be issued in the form and denominations and
executed in the manner and under the terms, conditions, and details

bonds or any instrument as security except as provided by this Act.
Nothing in this subsection may be constituted to deprive the state
and its governmental subdivisions of their respective police powers
or to impair any police power of any official or agency of the state
or its subdivisions as may be provided by law.
(f) The state pledges to and agrees with the owners of any
bonds issued in accordance with this chapter that the state will not
limit or alter the rights vested in the authority to fulfill the
terms of any agreements made with the owners of the bonds or in any
way impair the rights and remedies of those owners until those bonds,
together with any premium and the interest on the bonds and all costs
and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on
behalf of those owners, are fully met and discharged. The authority
is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state in
any agreement with the owners of those bonds.
(g) The bonds may be sold at public or private sale with or
without public bidding in the manner, at such rate or rates, price or
prices, and on such terms as may be determined by the board or
determined as provided in any contractual arrangement approved by the
board. The board also may enter into any contractual arrangement
under which the bonds are to be sold from time to time, or subject to
purchase, at such prices and rates, interest rate or payment periods,
and terms as determined pursuant to that contractual arrangement
approved by the board.
(h) Pending the preparation of definitive bonds, interim

authorized to issue a search warrant under Chapter 18, 18A, or 18B,
Code of Criminal Procedure, only after the department has exercised
reasonable efforts to obtain consent to conduct a search, and on
application by the department accompanied by a supporting affidavit

only that:
(1) the place or premises described in the application for
the warrant are located in an area subject to a quarantine
established by the department with respect to the plant pest or
disease that is the subject of the warrant; or
(2) there is a reasonable probability the place or premises
contain a plant pest or disease or are located in an area that is

SUBCHAPTER D. OFFICIAL COTTON GROWERS' BOLL WEEVIL ERADICATION
FOUNDATION
Sec. 74.101. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY. (a) It is
hereby found and declared that:
(1) the insects Anthonomus grandis Boheman, known as the
boll weevil, and Pectinophora gossypiella, known as the pink
bollworm, are public nuisances and a menace to the cotton industry,
and their eradication is a public necessity;
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 473 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

(2) because of the differences in soil conditions, growing
seasons, farming techniques, and climate conditions among several
areas in the state where cotton is grown, the eradication and
suppression of the nuisance can best be accomplished by dividing the
cotton-growing areas into separate zones so that integrated pest
management programs may be developed for each zone;
(3) there is a need for a quasi-governmental entity acting
under the supervision and control of the commissioner whose members
are actual cotton growers who would be represented on the board of
the entity by directors elected by them to manage eradication and
suppression programs and to furnish expertise in the field of insect
control and eradication, because such an entity would enhance the
interest and participation of cotton growers in the program;
(4) because of the progress made in eradication,
investments made by cotton growers in certain areas, the potential
injustice to certain cotton growers who have made such investments,
and the stage of development of the cotton crops in the statutory
eradication zones, an urgent public necessity exists to validate and
ratify the assessments, agreements, and obligations of the Texas Boll
Weevil Eradication Foundation, Inc., made or incurred by the
foundation and related to certain statutory zones;
(5) cotton growers, in partnership with the state and
federal governments, have made significant investments toward the
eradication of these pests in this state;
(6) it is essential to the well-being of the cotton
industry and the agricultural economy of this state that the
investments of the cotton growers and the state and federal
governments be protected; and
(7) the establishment of a maintenance program to be
carried out by the foundation under the supervision of the department
is required to protect the investments in eradication.
(b) It is the intent of the legislature that the program of
eradication and suppression be carried out with the best available
integrated pest management techniques.
(c) The department may recover costs for administration of this
subchapter.

Sec. 74.115. PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS; ASSESSMENT LIENS. (a) A
cotton grower who fails to pay an assessment levied under this
subchapter when due may be subject, after reasonable notice and
opportunity for hearing, to a penalty set by the commissioner. In
determining the amount of the penalty to be assessed, the
commissioner shall consider:
(1) the seriousness of the violation, including the nature,
circumstances, and extent of the violation;
(2) the history of previous violations;
(3) the amount necessary to deter future violations;
(4) the economic situation of the cotton grower; and
(5) any other matter that justice may require.
(b) The foundation may develop a compliance certificate program
to manage the payment and collection of an assessment levied under
this subchapter. Under the program the foundation, subject to
department rules, may issue a compliance certificate for cotton for
which an assessment has been paid.
(c) In addition to any other remedies for the collection of
assessments and penalties, the commissioner may adopt rules relating
to the compliance certificate program for eradication assessments.
The rules may include:
(1) provisions establishing and relating to the obligations
of growers, ginners, and buyers in due course of cotton produced in
active eradication zones to ensure that assessments are paid within a
prescribed time period;
(2) provisions allowing incentives in the form of
discounted assessments for growers who pay assessments within a
prescribed time period;
(3) provisions establishing penalties and interest against
growers who pay assessments after a prescribed time period; and
(4) other provisions the commissioner may determine are
proper.
(d) In addition to any other remedies for the collection of
assessments and penalties, an assessment lien in favor of the
foundation attaches and is perfected 60 days after the date the
foundation mails notice of the assessment on cotton produced and
harvested that year from the acreage that is subject to the
assessment that is due and unpaid. An assessment lien is not an
agricultural lien for the purposes of Chapter 9, Business & Commerce
Code, and is not subject to the provisions of that chapter. An

assessment lien is subject to and preempted by the Food Security Act
of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et seq.) and shall be treated under
that Act in the same manner as a security interest created by the
seller. A buyer of cotton takes free of the assessment lien if the
buyer:
(1) receives a compliance certificate issued by the
foundation when the buyer purchases the cotton that certifies that
the assessment has been paid to the foundation;
(2) pays for the cotton by a check on which the department
is named as a joint payee;
(3) does not receive notice of the assessment lien as
required by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et
seq.); or
(4) buys the cotton from a person other than the producer
of the cotton.
(e) The foundation may assign, with the approval of the
commissioner, assessments or liens in favor of the foundation as
collateral for a loan to the foundation only if the proceeds of the
loan are designated for use in the eradication zone from which the
assessments or liens originated.
(f) If the department has cause to believe that a violation of
this section or rules promulgated under this section has occurred,
the department may investigate and, during normal business hours,
audit and inspect the records of the person who is the subject of the
investigation.

and penalties for the year for which the application is made are due
on the later of:
(1) the date on which they would be due in the absence of
an application for exemption; or
(2) 30 days after the date the applicant receives notice of
the denial.
(g) In addition to the authority provided under Subsections
(a)-(f), the commissioner may reduce or waive assessment penalties as
appropriate and necessary.

Sec. 76.111. APPLICATOR BUSINESSES; PROOF OF FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY. (a) In this section:
(1) "Applicator business" means a person who applies a
state-limited-use or restricted-use pesticide or regulated herbicide
to the land of another for compensation and who:
(A) is a licensed commercial applicator; or
(B) employs at least one licensed commercial
applicator.
(2) "M-44 device" means a nonexplosive, spring-operated
mechanical device designed to deliver a capsule of sodium cyanide
into the mouth of the target animal as a method of livestock
predation control.
(b) This section does not apply to an employee or agent of an
applicator business.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by this section, each
applicator business shall file with the regulatory agency issuing the
license a liability insurance policy, certification of a policy, or
other proof of financial responsibility considered acceptable by the

department protecting persons who may suffer damages as a result of
the operations of the applicator business, its employees, and its
agents.
(d) The proof of financial responsibility required by this
section is not required to apply to damages or injury to agricultural
crops, plants, or land being worked on by the applicator business,
its employees, or its agents.
(e) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amount of
the proof of financial responsibility may not be less than $100,000
for each occurrence for property damage and may not be less than
$100,000 for each occurrence for bodily injury or a general aggregate
at a minimum of $200,000 for each occurrence. The head of a
regulatory agency by rule may require different amounts of coverage
for different classifications of operations under this chapter. Each
commercial M-44 applicator license applicant must provide proof of
financial responsibility acceptable to the department for bodily
injury and property damage coverage insuring the applicator against
liability for damage to persons or property occurring as a result of
operations performed in the course of the application to premises or
any other property under the applicator's care, custody, or control.
The department will strive to set minimum acceptable coverage at an
amount that is economically feasible to applicants. The coverage
must at all times be maintained at not less than the amount set by
the agency head or the Texas Department of Insurance.
(f) The head of a regulatory agency may accept a liability
insurance policy in the proper sum which has a deductible clause in
an amount of not more than $1,000 for the total amount of the
liability insurance policy required by this section. If the
applicator business has not satisfied the requirement of the
deductible amount in any prior legal claim, an agency head may not
accept a policy with a deductible clause unless the applicator
business furnishes the agency with a surety bond that satisfies the
amount of the deductible clause as to all claims that may arise as a
result of the operation of the applicator business.
(g) An applicator business shall cease state-limited-use or
restricted-use pesticide or regulated herbicide application
operations during a period in which the applicator business is unable
to provide adequate proof of financial responsibility under
Subsection (e).

Sec. 79.007. EXECUTION OF INTERSTATE COMPACT. This state
enters into a compact with all other states legally joining in the
compact in substantially the following form:
"INTERSTATE PEST CONTROL COMPACT
"ARTICLE I. FINDINGS
"The party states find that:
(1) in the absence of the higher degree of cooperation
among them possible under this Compact, the annual loss of
approximately 137 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is
virtually certain to continue, if not to increase;
(2) because of the varying climatic, geographic and
economic factors, each state may be affected differently by
particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to
protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious
dangers to them;
(3) the migratory character of pest infestations makes it
necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another to
complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of
infestation and reinfestation; and
(4) while every state is seriously affected by a
substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of
infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its
crops and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few
species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all
states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund,
from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest
control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they
may contribute in accordance with their relative interest, the most
equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control
programs.
"ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
"As used in this Compact, unless the context clearly requires a
different construction:
(1) "State" means a state, territory or possession of the
United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico.
(2) "Requesting state" means a state which invokes the
procedures of the Compact to secure the undertaking or

intensification of measures to control or eradicate one or more pests
within one or more other states.
(3) "Responding state" means a state requested to undertake
or intensify the measures to control or eradicate one or more pests.
(4) "Pest" means any invertebrate animal, pathogen,
parasitic plant or similar or allied organism which can cause disease
or damage in any crops, trees, shrubs, grasses, or other plants of
substantial value.
(5) "Insurance Fund" means the Pest Control Insurance Fund
established under this Compact.
(6) "Governing Board" means the administrators of this
Compact representing all of the party states when such administrators
are acting as a body in pursuance of authority vested in them by this
compact.
(7) "Executive committee" means the committee established
under Article V (e) of this compact.
"ARTICLE III. THE INSURANCE FUND
"There is hereby established a Pest Control Insurance Fund for
the purpose of financing other than normal pest control operations
which states may be called upon to engage in pursuant to this
Compact. The Insurance Fund shall contain moneys appropriated to it
by the party states and any donations and grants accepted by it. All
appropriations, except as conditioned by the rights and obligations
of party states expressly set forth in this Compact, shall be
unconditional and may not be restricted by the appropriating state to
use in the control of any specified pest or pests. Donations and
grants may be conditional or unconditional, provided that the
Insurance Fund shall not accept any donation or grant whose terms are
inconsistent with any provision of this Compact.
"ARTICLE IV. THE INSURANCE FUND, INTERNAL OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
"(a) The Insurance Fund shall be administered by a Governing
Board and Executive Committee as hereinafter provided. The actions of
the Governing Board and the Executive Committee pursuant to this
Compact shall be deemed the actions of the Insurance Fund.

binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total
number of votes on the Governing Board is cast in favor thereof.
Action of the Governing Board shall be only at a meeting at which a
majority of the members are present.

reports as it may deem desirable.
"(j) In addition to the powers and duties specifically
authorized and imposed, the Insurance Fund may do such other things
as are necessary and incidental to the conduct of its affairs

shall pass upon applications for assistance from the Insurance Fund
and authorize disbursements therefrom. When the Governing Board is
not in session, the Executive Committee thereof shall act as agent of
the Governing Board, with full authority to act for it in passing
upon such applications.

AGRICULTURE CODE

"(e) The Executive Committee shall be composed of the chairman
of the Governing Board and four additional members of the Governing
Board chosen by it so that there shall be one member representing
each of four geographic groupings of party states. The Governing
Board shall make such geographic groupings. If there is
representation of the United States on the Governing Board, one such
representative may meet with the Executive Committee. The chairman of
the Governing Board shall be chairman of the Executive Committee. No
action of the Executive Committee shall be binding unless taken at a
meeting at which at least four members of such Committee are present
and vote in favor thereof. Necessary expenses of each of the five
members of the Executive Committee incurred in attending meetings of
such Committee, when not held at the same time and place as a meeting
of the Governing Board, shall be charges against the Insurance Fund.
"ARTICLE VI. ASSISTANCE AND REIMBURSEMENT
"(a) Each party state pledges to each other party state that it
will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the
strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized
that performance of this responsibility involves:
(1) The maintenance of pest control and eradication
activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level
that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of
this Compact.
(2) The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of
interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been
done in the absence of this Compact.
"(b) Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present
within its borders but present within another party state, or
whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for
the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such
activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more
difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to
cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may
request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the
Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one
or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent,
or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or
reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the
responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or
control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use

AGRICULTURE CODE

moneys available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and
efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
"(c) In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance
Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
(1) A detailed statement of the circumstances which
occasion the request for the invoking of the Compact.
(2) Evidence that the nest on account of whose eradication
or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an
agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass, or other
plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
(3) A statement of the extent of the present and projected
program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full
information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program
or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefore, in
connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of
introduction of the pest concerned.
(4) Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as
detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for
the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a
reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3
constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.
(5) A declaration as to whether, to the best of its
knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the
invoking of the Compact in the particular instance can be abated by a
program undertaken with the aid of moneys from the Insurance Fund in
one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a
program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.
(6) Such other information as the Governing Board may
require consistent with the provisions of this Compact.
"(d) The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due
notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the
Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to
the Compact administrator of each party state and to such other
officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party
states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be
entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such
meeting.
"(e) Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this
Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and
upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes

AGRICULTURE CODE

of this Compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or
Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The
Governing Board or Executive Committee may meet at any time or place
for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and
all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee,
with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefore
shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and
preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
"(f) A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a
determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing
given within twenty days of the determination with which it is
dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next
meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive
Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of
its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as
the Governing Board may authorize.
"(g) Responding states required to undertake or increase
measures pursuant to this Compact may receive moneys from the
Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs
expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for
expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing
Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise
procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
"(h) Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the
Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the
Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely
assistance or participation which may be available from the federal
government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of
the federal government for such assistance and participation.
"(i) The Insurance Fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum
of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent
and degree of assistance or participation between and among the
Insurance Fund, cooperating federal agencies, states, and any other
entities concerned.
"ARTICLE VII. ADVISORY AND TECHNICAL COMMITTEES
"The Governing Board may establish advisory and technical
committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and
private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its
functions. Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or
members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 585 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee. An
advisory or technical committee may furnish information and
recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from
the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee and
the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same: provided
that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive
Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of the Compact shall be
entitled to know the substance of any such information and
recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or
as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at
which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its
disposition of the application.
"ARTICLE VIII. RELATIONS WITH NONPARTY JURISDICTIONS
"(a) A party state may make application for assistance from the
Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such
application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing
Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application
with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in
this Article.
"(b) At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing
Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of this
Compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate,
and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or
Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be
entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive
Committee.
"(c) The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize
expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state
only after determining that the conditions in such state and the
value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify
them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any
conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure
of moneys from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter
into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other
jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to
protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to
expenditures and activities outside of party states.
"ARTICLE IX. FINANCE
"(a) The Insurance Fund shall submit to the executive head or
designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 586 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

Insurance Fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that
party state for a presentation to the legislature thereof.
"(b) Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations
of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party
states. The request for appropriations shall be apportioned among the
party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal
shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural
and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products,
produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops
and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of
information as in its judgment present the most equitable and
accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and
requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used
in obtaining information concerning value of products.
"(c) The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be
maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the
"Operating Account" and the "Claims Account." The Operating Account
shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration
of the Insurance Fund during the next ensuing two-year period. The
Claims Account shall contain all moneys not included in the Operating
Account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be
sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the Insurance Fund for a
period of three years. At any time when the Claims Account has
reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the
addition of moneys requested for appropriation by the party states,
the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata
basis in such manner as to keep the Claims Account within such
maximum limit. Any moneys in the Claims Account by virtue of
conditional donations, grants, or gifts shall be included in
calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that
such moneys are available to meet demands arising out of the claims.
"(d) The Insurance Fund shall not pledge the credit of any
party state. The Insurance Fund may meet any of its obligations in
whole or in part with moneys available to it under Article IV (g) of
this Compact, provided that the Governing Board take specific action
setting aside such moneys prior to incurring any obligation to be met
in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Insurance Fund
makes use of moneys available to it under Article IV (g) hereof, the
Insurance Fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment
of moneys by the party states adequate to meet the same.

yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and report of the
audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of
the Insurance Fund.
"(f) The accounts of the Insurance Fund shall be open at any
reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the
party states and by any persons authorized by the Insurance Fund.
"ARTICLE X. ENTRY INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL
"(a) This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law
by any five or more states. Thereafter, this Compact shall become
effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.
"(b) Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take
effect until two years after the executive head of the withdrawing
state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive
heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any
liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to
the time of such withdrawal.
"ARTICLE XI. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
"This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate
the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this
Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state
or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any

CHAPTER 80.

OFFICIAL CITRUS PRODUCERS' PEST AND DISEASE
MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
Sec. 80.001. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY. (a) The
legislature finds that:
(1) citrus pests and diseases, including the insect known
as the Asian citrus psyllid and the disease known as citrus greening,
are public nuisances and menaces to the citrus industry, and their
control and suppression is a public necessity;
(2) because of the natural migration patterns of citrus
pests and the contagious nature of citrus diseases, the control and
suppression of the nuisance can best be accomplished by dividing the
commercial citrus-growing areas into separate zones so that
integrated pest management programs may be developed for each zone;
(3) there is a need for a quasi-governmental entity acting
under the supervision and control of the commissioner whose members
are actual citrus producers who would be represented on the board of
the entity by directors elected by them to manage control and
suppression programs and to furnish expertise in the field of disease
and insect control and suppression, because such an entity would
enhance the interest and participation of citrus producers in the
program;
(4) citrus producers, in partnership with the state and
federal governments, have made significant investments toward the
suppression of these pests and disease in this state; and
(5) it is essential to the well-being of the citrus
industry and the agricultural economy of this state that the
investments of the citrus producers and the state and federal
governments be protected.
(b) It is the intent of the legislature that the program of
control and suppression of citrus pests and diseases be carried out
with the best available integrated pest management techniques.
(c) The department may recover costs for administration of this
chapter.

Sec. 80.017. PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS; ASSESSMENT LIENS. (a) A
citrus producer who fails to pay an assessment levied under this
chapter when due may be subject, after reasonable notice and

The rules may include:
(1) provisions establishing and relating to the obligations

of growers, packers, and buyers in due course of citrus produced in
active pest management zones to ensure that assessments are paid
within a prescribed time period;
(2) provisions allowing incentives in the form of
discounted assessments for growers who pay assessments within a
prescribed time period;
(3) provisions establishing penalties and interest against
growers who pay assessments after a prescribed time period; and
(4) other provisions the commissioner determines are
proper.
(d) In addition to any other remedies for the collection of
assessments and penalties, an assessment lien in favor of the
corporation attaches and is perfected 60 days after the date the
corporation mails notice of the assessment on citrus produced and
harvested that year from the acreage that is subject to the
assessment that is due and unpaid. An assessment lien is not an
agricultural lien for the purposes of Chapter 9, Business & Commerce
Code, and is not subject to the provisions of that chapter. An
assessment lien is subject to and preempted by the Food Security Act
of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et seq.) and shall be treated under
that Act in the same manner as a security interest created by the
seller. A buyer of citrus takes free of the assessment lien if the
buyer:
(1) receives a compliance certificate issued by the
corporation when the buyer purchases the citrus that certifies that
the assessment has been paid to the corporation;
(2) pays for the citrus by a check on which the department
is named as a joint payee;
(3) does not receive notice of the assessment lien as
required by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et
seq.); or
(4) buys the citrus from a person other than the producer
of the citrus.
(e) The corporation may assign, with the approval of the
commissioner, assessments or liens in favor of the corporation as
collateral for a loan to the corporation only if the proceeds of the
loan are designated for use in the pest management zone from which
the assessments or liens originated.

or a rule adopted under this section has occurred, the department may

any time after an assessment becomes delinquent, the corporation may
investigate conditions that relate to the prompt remittance of the
assessment by a citrus producer.
(b) If the corporation determines that a citrus producer has
failed to remit an assessment to the corporation as required by this
chapter, the corporation may:
(1) independently bring suit against the citrus producer to
obtain appropriate injunctive relief or a judgment in the amount due
to the corporation, including:
(A) the amount of delinquent assessments;
(B) penalties assessed under Section 80.017(a); and
(C) interest on delinquent assessments and penalties;
or
(2) request the department, the attorney general, or a

corporation's behalf.
(c) A court shall order the injunctive relief necessary to
ensure payment of the delinquent assessments by the citrus producer.

the corporation may also seek to secure payment of assessments for
the current year that are not yet delinquent. The corporation shall
estimate the amount of any assessments for the year that have not yet
been made.
(f) A petition under Subsection (b) is sufficient if it alleges
that:
(1) the corporation is legally constituted and authorized
to impose and collect assessments from citrus producers;
(2) assessments in the amounts stated were legally imposed

SUBCHAPTER C. CITRUS MARKETING AGREEMENTS AND LICENSES
Sec. 102.151. POLICY. The unreasonable waste and inefficient
use of the citrus resources, caused by the marketing within this
state of greater quantities of fresh citrus fruit than are reasonably
necessary to supply the demands of the market, are not in the public
interest. The difficulty inherent in an attempt of individuals to
correlate within a reasonable degree the citrus production to current
demand creates chaotic economic conditions in the citrus areas of the
state of such severity as to imperil the ability of citrus producers
to contribute in appropriate amounts to the support of ordinary
governmental and educational functions, thus tending to increase the
tax burden of other taxpayers for the same purposes, and renders it
impossible for producers to be reasonably assured of an adequate
standard of living for themselves and their families. In the
interest of the public welfare and general prosperity of the state,
the unreasonable waste and inefficient use of citrus resources
involved in the marketing of citrus fruit in this state should be
eliminated, while at the same time preserving to citrus producers in
the area covered by this subchapter an equality of opportunity.

(2) "Handler" means a person who packs or ships citrus
fruit or causes citrus fruit to be packed or shipped in intrastate

that which is in interstate commerce or foreign commerce or which
directly burdens, obstructs, or affects interstate or foreign
commerce.
(4) "Person" means an individual, corporation, or
association.
(5) "Producer" means a person who is engaged in the
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 676 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

production of citrus fruit in this state for commercial purposes or
who is a substantial stockholder in a corporation engaged in the
production of citrus fruit in this state for commercial purposes.
(6) "Ship" means convey or cause to be conveyed in
intrastate commerce by rail, boat, truck, or other means, not
including parcel post or express, whether as owner, agent, or
otherwise.
(7) "Shipment" means the loading into a car or other
conveyance for transportation in intrastate commerce.

to be increased through the operation of the marketing plan;
(3) the marketing plan may be operated without permitting
unreasonable profits to producers of the citrus fruit and without
unreasonably enhancing prices of the citrus fruit to consumers; and
(4) the marketing plan will tend to advance public welfare
and conserve the agricultural wealth of the state by preventing
threatened economic or agricultural waste and will tend to prevent
chaotic marketing of the citrus fruit.
(b) The findings of the department, and the administration of
any marketing agreement or license, shall be based on relevant
considerations, including:
(1) the quantity of the several grades, varieties, and

SUBTITLE G. WORKPLACE CHEMICALS
CHAPTER 125. AGRICULTURAL HAZARD COMMUNICATION ACT
Sec. 125.001. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE. The legislature finds
that the health and safety of persons living and working in
agricultural areas in the state may be improved by providing access
to information regarding certain hazardous chemicals to which they
may be exposed either during their normal employment activities,
during emergency situations, or as a result of proximity to the use
of those chemicals. The legislature also finds that, because of the
conditions of agricultural employment, there is a unique situation
regarding certain agricultural laborers that makes it necessary to
establish formal procedures to provide access to information
regarding certain hazardous chemicals and to assure those laborers
that there will be no retaliation by the employer for the exercise of
rights under this chapter. This chapter is intended to assure that
accessibility to information regarding chemicals covered by this
chapter be provided to agricultural laborers who may be exposed to
those chemicals in agricultural workplaces, to certain emergency
service organizations responsible for dealing with chemical hazards
during emergency situations when those chemicals are in close
proximity to residential areas, and to the department to make the
information available to the general public through specific
procedures.

one escrow account under this section, the milk processor may combine

who have not received full payment and for whose benefit the account
was established, the agent of the institution with whom the escrow
account is established shall distribute the funds in proportion to
the amount then due to each dairy farmer.

TITLE 7. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
CHAPTER 201. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 201.001. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY. (a) The
legislature finds that the farm and grazing lands of the State of
Texas are among the basic assets of the state and that the
preservation of these lands is necessary to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of its people; that improper
land-use practices have caused and have contributed to, and are now
causing and contributing to, progressively more serious erosion of
the farm and grazing lands of this state by wind and water; that the
breaking of natural grass, plant, and forest cover has interfered
with the natural factors of soil stabilization, causing loosening of
soil and exhaustion of humus, and developing a soil condition that
favors erosion; that the topsoil is being blown and washed out of
fields and pastures; that there has been an accelerated washing of
sloping fields; that these processes of erosion by wind and water
speed up with removal of absorptive topsoil, causing exposure of less
absorptive and less protective but more erosive subsoil; that
failure by an occupier of land to conserve the soil and control
erosion upon the land causes a washing and blowing of soil and water
onto other lands and makes the conservation of soil and control of
erosion on those other lands difficult or impossible.

(b) The consequences of soil erosion in the form of soilblowing and soil-washing are the silting and sedimentation of stream
channels, reservoirs, dams, ditches, and harbors; the loss of
fertile soil material in dust storms; the piling up of soil on lower
slopes, and its deposit over alluvial plains; the reduction in
productivity or outright ruin of rich bottom lands by overwash of
poor subsoil material, sand, and gravel swept out of the hills;
deterioration of soil and its fertility, deterioration of crops, and
declining acre yields despite development of scientific processes for
increasing such yields; loss of soil and water that causes
destruction of food and cover for wildlife; a blowing and washing of
soil into streams that silt over spawning beds and destroy
waterplants, diminishing the food supply of fish; a diminishing of
the underground water reserve that causes water shortages,
intensifies periods of drought, and causes crop failures; an
increase in the speed and volume of rainfall runoff, causing severe
and increasing floods that bring suffering, disease, and death;
impoverishment of families attempting to farm eroding and eroded
lands; damage to roads, highways, railways, farm buildings, and
other property from floods and from dust storms; and losses in
navigation, hydroelectric power, municipal water supply, irrigation
developments, farming, and grazing.
(c) In order to conserve soil resources and control and prevent
soil erosion, it is necessary that land-use practices contributing to
soil waste and soil erosion may be discouraged and discontinued, and
appropriate soil-conserving land-use practices be adopted and carried
out. Among the procedures necessary for widespread adoption are
engineering operations such as the construction of terraces, terrace
outlets, check dams, dikes, ponds, ditches, and the like; the
utilization of strip-cropping, lister furrowing, contour cultivating,
and contour furrowing; land irrigation; seeding and planting of
waste, sloping, abandoned, or eroded lands to water-conserving and
erosion-preventing plants, trees, and grasses; forestation and
reforestation; rotation of crops, soil stabilization with trees,
grasses, legumes, and other thick-growing, soil-holding crops,
retardation of runoff by increasing absorption of rainfall; and
retirement from cultivation of steep, highly erosive areas and areas
now badly gullied or otherwise eroded.
(d) It is the policy of the legislature to provide for the
conservation of soil and related resources of this state and for the

Sec. 201.026. NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION. (a) The state board
is the lead agency in this state for activity relating to abating
agricultural and silvicultural nonpoint source pollution.
(b) As the lead agency, the state board shall:
(1) plan, implement, and manage programs and practices for
abating agricultural and silvicultural nonpoint source pollution;
(2) have as a goal:
(A) setting priorities among voluntary efforts to
reduce nonpoint source pollution and promoting those efforts in a
manner consistent with the priorities; and
(B) assisting landowners to prevent regulatory
enforcement actions related to nonpoint source pollution; and
(3) provide to the agricultural community information
regarding the jurisdictions of the state board and the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality related to nonpoint source
pollution.
(c) Except as required by Subchapter L, Chapter 26, Water Code,
a permit or other authorization is not required under that chapter as
a prerequisite for the land application of animal waste for
beneficial use at agronomic rates to property that is not owned or
controlled by the owner or operator of a facility that Chapter 26,
Water Code, requires to hold a permit or other authorization. This
section does not affect the authority of the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality to investigate or take enforcement action
against a point source discharge under Section 26.121, Water Code.
(d) On the request of the owner of land on which animal waste
is applied for agricultural purposes, the state board may create and
certify a water quality management plan for the land.
(e) Other state agencies with responsibility for abating
agricultural and silvicultural nonpoint source pollution shall
coordinate any abatement programs and activities with the state
board.
(f) The state board shall represent the state before the
federal Environmental Protection Agency or other federal agencies on
a matter relating to agricultural or silvicultural nonpoint source

pollution. Nothing herein shall impair the ability of:
(1) the General Land Office to represent the state before
any federal agency in matters relating to the state's participation
in the federal coastal zone management program;
(2) the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to
represent the state before any federal agency in matters relating to
the state's overall participation in the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.); or
(3) the Texas Department of Agriculture to represent the
state before any federal agency in matters relating to the state's
overall participation in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. Section 136 et seq.).
(g) In an area that the state board identifies as having or
having the potential to develop agricultural or silvicultural
nonpoint source water quality problems or an area within the "coastal
zone" designated by the commissioner of the General Land Office, the
state board shall establish a water quality management plan
certification program that provides, through local soil and water
conservation districts, for the development, supervision, and
monitoring of individual water quality management plans for
agricultural and silvicultural lands. Each plan must be developed,
maintained, and implemented under rules and criteria adopted by the
state board and comply with state water quality standards established
by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The state board
shall certify a plan that satisfies the state board's rules and
criteria and complies with state water quality standards established
by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality under the
commission's exclusive authority to set water quality standards for
all water in the state.
(h) At the request of the landowner, the state board may
develop and certify a water quality management plan for any
agricultural or silvicultural land in the state. Section 26.302(b1), Water Code, applies to a water quality management plan developed
or certified for use by a poultry facility under this section.
(i) A water quality management plan developed under this
section that covers land on which animal carcasses will be buried
must include:
(1) disposal management practices for the carcasses,
including a requirement that poultry carcasses may be buried on site
only in the event of a major die-off that exceeds the capacity of a

poultry facility to handle and dispose of poultry carcasses by the
normal means used by the facility; and
(2) burial site requirements that identify suitable
locations for burial based on site-specific factors including:
(A) land use;
(B) soil conditions; and
(C) proximity to groundwater or surface water supplies.
(j) The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality may not
require a landowner who requests and complies with a water quality
management plan under Subsection (i) to record the burial of animal
carcasses in the county deed records or report the burial to the
commission.
(k) The state board shall notify the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality not later than the 10th business day after the
date the state board decertifies a water quality management plan for
an animal feeding operation.
(l) The state board shall update the state board's
identification of priority areas for the control of nonpoint source
pollution at least every four years. The state board, in considering
changes to the identified priority areas, shall consider:
(1) bodies of water the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality has identified as impaired through the state water quality
assessment process;
(2) threatened areas in which action is necessary to
prevent nonpoint source pollution; and
(3) other areas of concern, including groundwater concerns.
(m) Complaints concerning a violation of a water quality
management plan or a violation of a law or rule relating to
agricultural or silvicultural nonpoint source pollution under the
jurisdiction of the state board shall be referred to the state board.
The state board, in cooperation with the local soil and water
conservation district, shall investigate the complaint. On
completion of the investigation, the state board, in consultation
with the soil and water conservation district, either shall determine
that further action is not warranted or shall develop and implement a
corrective action plan to address the complaint. If the person about
whom the complaint has been made fails or refuses to take corrective
action, the state board shall refer the complaint to the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.

conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of
its agricultural land for the production of food and other
agricultural products. It is the purpose of this chapter to reduce
the loss to the state of its agricultural resources by limiting the
circumstances under which agricultural operations may be regulated or
considered to be a nuisance.
Added by Acts 1981, 67th Leg., p. 2595, ch. 693, Sec. 21, eff. Aug.

Sec. 251.003. ESTABLISHED DATE OF OPERATION. For purposes of
this chapter, the established date of operation is the date on which
an agricultural operation commenced operation. If the physical
facilities of the agricultural operation are subsequently expanded,
the established date of operation for each expansion is a separate
and independent established date of operation established as of the
date of commencement of the expanded operation, and the commencement
of expanded operation does not divest the agricultural operation of a
previously established date of operation.
Added by Acts 1981, 67th Leg., p. 2595, ch. 693, Sec. 21, eff. Aug.
31, 1981.

Sec. 251.004. NUISANCE ACTIONS. (a) No nuisance action may be

operation for one year or more prior to the date on which the action
is brought, if the conditions or circumstances complained of as

constituting the basis for the nuisance action have existed
substantially unchanged since the established date of operation.
This subsection does not restrict or impede the authority of this
state to protect the public health, safety, and welfare or the
authority of a municipality to enforce state law.
(b) A person who brings a nuisance action for damages or
injunctive relief against an agricultural operation that has existed
for one year or more prior to the date that the action is instituted
or who violates the provisions of Subsection (a) of this section is
liable to the agricultural operator for all costs and expenses
incurred in defense of the action, including but not limited to
attorney's fees, court costs, travel, and other related incidental
expenses incurred in the defense.
(c) This section does not affect or defeat the right of any
person to recover for injuries or damages sustained because of an
agricultural operation or portion of an agricultural operation that
is conducted in violation of a federal, state, or local statute or
governmental requirement that applies to the agricultural operation
or portion of an agricultural operation.

purposes of this section, the effective date of a governmental
requirement is the date on which the requirement requires or attempts
to require compliance as to the geographic area encompassed by the

does not change the original effective date to the extent of the
original requirements.
(b) A governmental requirement of a political subdivision of
the state other than a city:
(1) applies to an agricultural operation with an
established date of operation subsequent to the effective date of the
requirement;
(2) does not apply to an agricultural operation with an
established date of operation prior to the effective date of the
requirement; and
(3) applies to an agricultural operation if the
Statute text rendered on: 8/6/2022

- 1081 -

AGRICULTURE CODE

governmental requirement was in effect and was applicable to the
operation prior to the effective date of this chapter.
(c) A governmental requirement of a city does not apply to any
agricultural operation situated outside the corporate boundaries of
the city on the effective date of this chapter. If an agricultural
operation so situated is subsequently annexed or otherwise brought
within the corporate boundaries of the city, the governmental
requirements of the city do not apply to the agricultural operation
unless the requirement is reasonably necessary to protect persons who
reside in the immediate vicinity or persons on public property in the
immediate vicinity of the agricultural operation from the danger of:
(1) explosion, flooding, vermin, insects, physical injury,
contagious disease, removal of lateral or subjacent support,
contamination of water supplies, radiation, storage of toxic
materials, or traffic hazards; or
(2) discharge of firearms or other weapons, subject to the
restrictions in Section 229.002, Local Government Code.
(c-1) A governmental requirement may be imposed under
Subsection (c) only after the governing body of the city makes
findings by resolution that the requirement is necessary to protect
public health. Before making findings as to the necessity of the
requirement, the governing body of the city must use the services of
the city health officer or employ a consultant to prepare a report to
identify the health hazards related to agricultural operations and
determine the necessity of regulation and manner in which
agricultural operations should be regulated.
(c-2) A governmental requirement of a city relating to the
restraint of a dog that would apply to an agricultural operation
under Subsection (c) does not apply to a dog used to protect
livestock on property controlled by the property owner while the dog
is being used on such property for that purpose.
(d) This section shall be construed to maintain, to the limited
degree set forth in this section, the authority of a political
subdivision under prior law over nonconforming uses but may not be
construed to expand that authority.
(e) A governmental requirement of a political subdivision of
the state does not apply to conduct described by Section 42.09(f),
Penal Code, on an agricultural operation.
